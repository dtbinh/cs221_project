abstract
nasas kepler mission to search for extrasolar planets has collected data from hundreds of thousands of star systems 
and has discovered nearly      confirmed exoplanets to date in addition to over      unconfirmed candidates  the mission
detects exoplanets using transit photometry  which detects the transit of a planet in front of a star as transient drops in
stellar intensity  raw data is collected in the form of a sequence of stellar images  which are processed into light curves
tracking the brightness of a star over time  an algorithm automatically searches for periodic planetary transits in these
light curves  but spurious intensity dips and other noise in the data due to non planetary stellar variability has led to high
false positive rates for detecting transits  as the initial planetary candidates found by this search method require extensive
and costly subsequent validation  there is a need to reduce the error rate in exoplanet candidate identification  we present
here an algorithm to classify kepler objects of interest  kois  as confirmed exoplanets or false positives  using publicly
available kepler data  the algorithm achieves a     accuracy  and uses previously generated features extracted from the
lightcurve time series data  as well as newly generated autocorrelation features derived from the time series specifically
during planetary transit 

 

introduction

nasas kepler spacecraft spent over four years collecting data on hundreds of thousands of star systems in search of
exoplanets  this data was collected by taking images of a constant patch of space every    minutes on a continuous basis
for   months  i e    quarter   every   months the spacecraft was recalibrated and the cycle was repeated for    separate
quarters before the kepler spacecraft failed  from these images  the pixels corresponding to stars were isolated  and the
pixel location and intensity values were recorded over time  taken together  this generated a series of light curves for each
tracked star  from which exoplanets would be detected using transit photometry by looking for characteristic intensity dips
as planets transit in front of the star 
currently  these light curves are further processed to remove instrument related artifacts  known as presearch data
conditioning or pdc   before being fed into a wavelet based filter  known as transiting planet search or tps  that detects
the periodic dips characteristic of planetary transits  these automatic algorithms generate a series of exoplanet candidates
known as kois  kepler objects of interest   and manual follow up measurements are conducted either to confirm kois as
exoplanets or false positives  so far       kois have been identified  out of which      have been followed up on  the
results of the follow up observation has yielded a large false positive rate  as only      exoplanets have been confirmed 
note that some systems contain more than one koi  and so accounting by stars  kepler has identified      stars with
kois  out of which     have been confirmed to actually harbour exoplanets  false positives come from a variety of sources 
such as intrinsic stellar variability  eg  bursting   random background objects  or from binary star systems  in which one star
transits in front of another  
given the time consuming and costly nature of follow up experiments  much of the analysis is done manually   better
algorithms are needed to predict from the raw light curve data whether or not a star system contains exoplanets  for our
project  we sought to produce a learning algorithm that can predict whether a koi is a false positive or a confirmed exoplanet 
ideally producing as few false negatives as possible  high sensitivity so as to not miss exoplanets   while reducing the number
of false positives that require expensive follow up studies 

 

data

light curve files for the      classified kois are publicly available from nasas mast servers  in the form of  fits files
 an astronomy standard   these  fits files store time series data on stellar intensity and pixel location  as well as various
other data such as measurement uncertainties and data quality flags  note that since multiple kois can be based around
the same star  different kois can have identical  fits data  there is only one set of  fits time series for each star   over the
course of a   month long quarter       data points are gathered in the time series  one cadence every    minutes   in
addition to the time series data  the  fits files are supplemented by previously gathered spectroscopic and other potentially
relevant information on the stars of interest  eg  size  temperature  etc   reported as    numerical features  using this set
of data  it makes sense to classify stars as harbouring  or not harbouring  exoplanets  rather than classify kois themselves 
 

finote that not all quarters of data are available for all stars and furthermore during each quarter there are certain times
when the spacecraft faced technical difficulties for which the time series data has missing values reported as nan  removing
these problematic points  our final data consists of just under      stars  roughly     of which harbour exoplanets  the rest
being false positives  for each of these examples  we are able to retrieve a    long feature vector of stellar characteristics  as
well as a set of approximately      long time series data on stellar intensity  both raw and calibrated for kepler spacecraft
artifacts  and pixel location  horizontal and vertical   to correct for the imbalance between positive and negative examples
in this dataset  when training we selected a random subset of negative examples equal in size to the positive example set 
another set of features includes a set of    koi specific measurements extracted from the time series data using previously
published algorithms  these data are again available from the mast servers  and we did not have to calculate them
ourselves  these features include the estimated magnitude and duration of detected transits  estimated radius  temperature 
and eccentricity of the exoplanet  and other similar features which are derived by fitting physical models to the time series
data  these features are specific to the koi  rather than to the star   so by using this data  we can directly classifly kois as
exoplanets or false positives  we noted there is some overlap between this nasa generated koi specific data and the starspecific data discussed above  furthermore  the koi specific data had numerous missing values  removing these examples
reduced our dataset to      koi examples  roughly half of which are confirmed exoplanets 
our initial tests used only star specific features and sought to binary classify stars as harbouring exoplanets or not  our
second round of tests used the koi specific data provided by nasa  as well as cross correlation features we generated
ourselves from the raw time series data  see below   and sought to classify kois as true exoplanets or false positives 

 
   
     

features and preprocessing
extracting features for prediction of stars that harbour true exoplanets
star specific characteristics

we discovered that there is significant dependence among the    variables on intrinsic stellar characteristics  derived directly
from the  fits files   so data reduction was performed by using principal components analysis and selecting the top   
components to use as features 
     

star specific time series processing

starting from the raw light curve and stellar characteristics data  a key challenge of this problem is in extracting informative
features with which to predict exoplanet existence  given that the length of the time series data is over      data points per
example  which exceeds the total number of examples  and outnumbers positive training examples by more than a factor of
    it is virtually infeasible to directly use the numerical time series as a feature vector for classification  to gain an intuition
for other strategies of feature extraction  we looked in more detail at the raw light curve data  strikingly  these light curve
data often appear to have a periodic nature to them  though simply looking for periodic transits themselves can be very
misleading  see figure     large transits can be seen in both positive and negative data  and a lack of any obvious transits
is present as well in example data from both positive and negative data  we hypothesized that in addition to periodicity
of the transits  or lack thereof   additional information stored in other frequencies of the light curves might help distinguish
genuine planetary transits from artifacts 
as a basic feature extraction strategy  we attempted to characterize each time series by simple global measurements 
including the mean  median  min  max  standard deviation  and inter quartile range of the light curve as a whole  next  we
tried downsampling the      pixel intensities over time into a     long vector  we also tried feature mapping by running
a fast fourier transform  fft  on the raw light curves  and sampling a     dimensional array of the fft as the new feature
vector  the benefit of this method is that it separates out the long time variation in the star systems intensity  which could
be likely due to intrinsic variation in the stars luminous output  and also isolates much of the high frequency noise in the
data collection as well  next  we combined not just the basic light curve data but also measurements on the motion of the
star centroid  which gives an estimate of the wobble caused by a potential exoplanet  that dataset is an entire time series
on its own  but by measuring the correlations between that dataset  for both x and y centroid motion  and the light curves 
we came up with the   pairwise correlations between each of the three time series to use as features 

   
     

extracting features for prediction of kois that are true exoplanets
koi specific characteristics

we discovered that there is significant dependence among the    koi specific variables and the    star specific variables
mentioned  so data reduction was performed by combining these into a    long vector and using principal components
analysis to select the top    components as features 

 

fifigure    light curves can be misleading  one can see that the left traces represent exoplanet harbouring stars  whereas the
right traces represent non exoplanet harbouring stars  however clear transits  or lack thereof  can be observed in both cases 
     

koi specific time series processing

a key variable available from the koi specific data is the timepoint at which planet transit occurs within the raw timeseries
data  using this  we reduced our      dimensional raw timeseries data to the    timepoints closest to the transit event 
we then calculated centroid to flux cross correlation using these short time windows  and used the corresponding    long
cross correlation vectors as additional features  compared to calculating correlations with full time series  we expected this
technique to much better capture exoplanet related wobble  to further reduce noise  we first applied a flatten   detrend
algorithm to the timeseries data  using the pyke data package  software developed by nasa for analysing kepler data  

 

models and results

our problem is one of binary classification  the algorithms we used are naive bayes  logistic regression  and svm  gaussian
and or linear kernel  see below for details   the performance of these algorithms was quantified using   fold cross validation
to generate test error rates 

   

initial attempts at classifying stars

in our initial work  we ran a series of classification attempts on the star dataset  ultimately with marginal success  first  we
began by exploring the notion of how well the star specific features of the star system  no light curve data  could classify
exoplanets  given that certain types of stars may be intrinsically more likely than others to harbour exoplanets  the ability to
predict exoplanets based on these characteristic features provides a useful baseline  after applying pca  we find that using
these features alone yields        accuracy in detection  depending on the classification algorithm used  of the classification
algorithm types tested  svm appears to suffer from overfitting  training error  test error  while nave bayes suffers from high
variance  high training test error  so logistic regression emerges as the frontrunner  following the classification algorithms
using just the star features  we re ran the classification algorithms  but added features extracted from the light curve timeseries in the form of global time series statistics  downsampled time series  fft  and momentum correlations  using these
additional features did not increase algorithm performance with any of the three classification algorithms  as compared to
using only the global star features  as before  svm appears to suffer from overfitting  training error  test error  while
nave bayes has lost almost all accuracy  and logistic regression test accuracy remains near      a summary of all these
techniques tried with the stellar characteristics  light curve  and centroid data is given in table      note we later re analysed
this data using linear kernel svm  which yielded performance similar to logistic regression  data not shown  

   

classification of kois

as our initial attempts at binary classification of stars did no better than       we shifted our focus to the alternate
strategy of classifying kois directly using the koi specific  rather than star specific  features  applied on the dataset of

kois  labelled as confirmed exoplanet or false positive  
as before  we began by exploring the notion of how well the characteristic koi features  no time series data  could classify
exoplanets  after applying pca  we find that using these features alone yields      accuracy in detection  depending on
the classification algorithm used  given earlier problems with overfitting using gaussian kernel svm  we tried a linear
kernel svm  of the classification algorithm types tested  logistic regression performs best with a     accuracy  but the
performance of svm and naive bayes is not far behind  training and test accuracies are similar  suggesting that overfitting
is not a problem with our current feature set  for details on performance  see table    and the roc curves shown in figure
   the high accuracy suggests that the currently available kepler features can be directly used to predict exoplanets versus
false positives  even without costly manual follow up  as a side note  we did run this dataset with gaussian kernel svm 
and as before we observed major over fitting  data not shown

we further tested whether our features we derived for the earlier attempts could improve the classification attempts here 
in particular  we supplemented the stellar and koi characteristics with the correlations we calculated earlier between the
light curves and the centroid movements  we then reran classification with the new feature set  results depicted in table  
and in figure     no significant improvement is seen in performance with any of the three classification algorithms  suggesting
that little if any predictive information is available from the cross correlation vectors  again  logistic regression appears to
be be the best performing algorithm  followed by linear kernel svm 

 

discussion and future directions

our initial work for this project attempted to classify stars as harboring or not harboring exoplanets based on measurements
from the kepler spacecraft  this work is applicable to any stars which were measured by the spacecraft  regardless of
whether they were picked out by nasa algorithms as kepler objects of interest  kois   despite several attempts  our best
classification algorithm classified stars solely based on their intrinsic characteristics  and not by any time series data  light

figure    roc curves for the classification on stellar and koi characteristics plus our correlation features
curves and centroid data   interestingly  this still achieved an accuracy of      which indicates that either certain types of
stars are more likely to harbor exoplanets  certainly possible given that a neutron star has little in common with a red giant 
for example   but could also indicate that nasas algorithms for koi detection has a bias for certain types of stars  given
the first case  we could run our algorithm on unclassified data to obtain an order of magnitude estimate  with     accuracy 
for the number of planet harboring stars  such orders of magnitude are of interest to astronomers  given the second case 
nasas algorithms could benefit from a correction of such bias 
our subsequent work for this project attempted to directly classify kois as confirmed or false exoplanets based on
measurements from the kepler spacecraft  as such  this work is not applicable to all stars for which kepler took measurements 
only those identified by nasas transit detection algorithms  our classification algorithm can be used as another step in
the planet finding pipeline  where it serves to weed out false positives prior to follow up measurements  given that the
manual follow up measurements can be quite costly  there is a real need for algorithms which reduce the large number of false
positive kois  to demonstrate that ability  we ran our logistic regression classifier with the koi specific feature set  ignoring
the added correlation features  on      currently unclassified kois for which sufficient data was available  of those     
were classified as true exoplanets  and      were weeded out as false positives  a list of the predicted exoplanets and false
negatives is given in the appendix  we hope these serve as useful starting points for other planet hunters 
given the variability in the data and relatively high accuracy achieved on koi classification using logistic regression  it
seems unlikely that a simple classification algorithm will yield significant improvements  future possible directions could be
to find better feature mappings to make use of the time series data  such as hidden markov models for transit detection and
dynamic time warping for detecting similarities in time series data  further classification algorithms can also be explored 
such as random forest and neural networks for deep learning of time series data
