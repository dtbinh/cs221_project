abstract
to better understand the meaning of positions in the nba  i train several models to predict a players
position from his stats  such as average speed on the court and number of three point attempts per
game  the nba and espn use different position labels  so i compare the performance of my models in
predicting these labels separately  ultimately  i hope that this analysis can determine how well position
labels describe nba player roles and identify the defining characteristics of each position 

 

introduction

basketball is a unique sport in that there are no position specific rules or statistics  all players are traditionally
measured by the number of rebounds  blocks  and steals they get on defense and the number of points they
score  passes they make  and assists they get on offense  therefore  position labels can be somewhat ambiguous 
the nba classifies players as either a guard  guard forward  forward  forward center  or center  and espn
classifies players as either a point guard  shooting guard  small forward  power forward  or center  this
has led some to do cluster analysis on nba players to discover more and new positions other than the
traditional five     
the goal of this analysis is to determine how well existing position labels actually describe a players game 
this is done by building models to predict position label from player stats  i consider two different position
labeling schemes  namely those given by the nba and espn  and compare model performance in predicting
these labels separately  in addition  by analyzing these models  i can identify the features that are most
predictive of position 

 

data

this analysis looks at     players from the           nba season  i use    features for each player to predict
two separate position labels 

   

response

i scraped players nba and espn position labels from those organizations respective websites          table
  below shows the relationship between these two position labeling schemes for players from the          
season  the middle row of this table  for example  says that among players classified by the nba as forwards 
espn classifies about half of them as small forwards and the other half as power forwards

predictors

prior to the           season  the nba installed sportvu cameras into every teams arena  these cameras
capture what is known as player tracking data  which consists of advanced player stats such as distance
traveled and secondary assists  these are the stats that i use as predictors 
because of the novelty of these cameras  i am limited to one full season of this data  i further condensed
my dataset by including only players who played at least    games during the season and averaged at least
   minutes per game in order to ensure that each player had sufficient data 
the player tracking data contains around     features for each player  but much of it is repetitive  for
example  points per game is included but so are total points and number of games played  additionally  this
analysis attempts to focus on style of play as opposed to quality of play  meaning that i am interested in
statistics such as number of three point attempts rather than three point percentage  table   below shows
the features that this analysis considers  all of which are continuous

standardizing the data

because most of the stats are given on a per game basis and not all players play the same amount of time
during a game  i standardized these statistics to be reported on a per    minute basis  specifically  if statistic
sp is reported as a per game statistic  e g  blocks per game  for player p and player p plays on average mp
s
minutes per game  i transform the statistic as mpp     

 

fis s

to allow for more interpretable results  i then standardized each variable as ps   where sp is the players
stat  and s and s are the average and standard deviation of that stat respectively across all players 

 

models

i explored three different models that perform multi class classification  multinomial logistic regression 
linear discriminant analysis  and support vector machine 

   

multinomial logistic regression

for a classification problem with k classes  multinomial logistic regression estimates k    coefficient vectors 
         k  and defines k to be the zero vector  these coefficient vectors determine the probability that
a given sample x belongs to any of the k classes  predictions are assigned to the class with the highest
probability  formally  if y           k are the k classes 
exp jt x 
j       k   
p  y   j x      pk
t
i   exp i x 

p  y   k x        

k 
x

p  y   i x   

i  

in this analysis  coefficients are estimated using the multinom function in rs nnet library  the utility of
these coefficients in understanding how this model makes predictions is explained later in this paper 

   

linear discriminant analysis

lda models p x y  as a multivariate normal distribution  and a strong assumption is that all classes share
the same covariance matrix    formally 
x y   i  n  i    
this could be problematic in this dataset because some features may vary a lot more for certain positions
than others  centers  for example  rarely drive the ball because they spend most of their time on offense
under the basket  so the drives dvs feature should have a relatively small variance for centers  however 
there should be a lot more variance for this feature among guards because some guards drive the ball while
others are primarily perimeter shooters  in future analysis  i will look at quadratic discriminant analysis  a
generalization of lda where each class has a separate covariance matrix  in order to hopefully remedy this
problem  i use the lda function in rs mass library to implement lda 

   

support vector machine

to implement svm  i use the svm function in rs e     library  this is rs implementation of libsvm 
for multi class classification with svm  libsvm uses the one against one approach in which k k      
classifiers are built  each of which trains on data from only two classes      i experimented with several
different kernels  including linear and radial kernels  but i only report the error from the linear kernel because
this performed best 

 

results

i assessed the performance of these models in two ways  first  i trained on a random     split of the data
     players   tested on the remaining          players   and reported the training and test error  second 
i performed    fold cross validation and reported this estimate of test error  the error metric used is the
misclassification rate  tables  a and  b summarize the results

error analysis

a confusion matrix gives a better idea of the performance of these models because certain misclassifications
are better worse than others  basketball positions fall roughly on a spectrum with guards on one end and
centers on the other  therefore  we absolutely do not want to see a point guard classified as a center  but
it is understandable to have a point guard classified as a shooting guard  table   shows a confusion matrix
of the espn position predictions of multinomial logistic regression on a     test set  the first column  for
example  says that among point guards  this model classified    as point guards and   as shooting guards

discussion

svm outperformed the other models when training and testing on a       split  results not shown   but the
other models caught up quickly as demonstrated by the errors for the       split in tables  a and  b  all of
the models ultimately produced remarkably similar levels of accuracy on both position labeling schemes  and
none of them were able to predict position with greater than roughly     accuracy  this result suggests that
there is a lot of overlap among positions 
this analysis can also be used to better understand the existing position labels  in table    we see that
there are several power forwards classified as centers  two of whom are pau gasol and tiago splitter  what
separates these players from other power forwards  by analyzing the multinomial logistic regression model
coefficients  we can answer this question  both gasol and splitter are distinguished by their above average
rebounding ability  and as a result  they both have large positive values for rebounding oreb chance
and rebounding dreb chance  conversely  the power forward coefficients for these two features are very
negative in the model that uses center as the referent group  the group for which the coefficients are defined
to be zero   referring to the equations for multinomial logistic regression detailed previously  this means
that positive rebounding values  above average   boost a players probability of being a center relative to
being a power forward  and vice versa  this partly explains why both gasol and splitter were classified as
centers 
similar analysis of these coefficients can be done for other positions as well  point guards have a much
higher positive coefficient than all other positions for passing pass  meaning that if a player makes a lot of
passes  his probability of being a point guard relative to being any other position is boosted  point guards 
shooting guards  and small forwards all have a similar positive coefficient for pullupshoot fg a while this
coefficient for power forwards is near zero  thus  if a player takes a lot of pull up threes  his probability of
being either a point guard  shooting guard  or small forward goes up relative to his probability of being a
power forward or a center

conclusions

i expected that i would not be able to predict position with very high accuracy  in theory  basketball positions
are well defined  point guards possess and pass the ball while shooting guards take shots  but in reality 
the lines between positions are blurred  the fact that i was able to achieve similar accuracy with two different
position labels  albeit with substantial overlap  reinforces this notion  these results suggest that doing a
cluster analysis to redefine positions in basketball is justified  such as that done by lutz     
however  this analysis does provide a lot of insight into what features are characteristic of existing positions 
by interpreting the coefficients of the multinomial logistic regression model for example  we were able to see
which features distinguished different positions  this paper details only a small portion of the information
about positions that can be inferred from this analysis 

 

future

because the player tracking data exists for only one full season  i was limited by a small sample size  as
more data becomes available  i will be able to extend my analysis further  i also need to address problems
of collinearity in the dataset  some features  such as number of possessions and time of possession  show
some correlation  and this causes these features to have unstable coefficient estimates in multinomial logistic
regression  similarly  i would like to use a more elaborate feature selection strategy  finally  i would like to
try quadratic discriminant analysis because this model does not have the potentially problematic assumption
of lda described previously
