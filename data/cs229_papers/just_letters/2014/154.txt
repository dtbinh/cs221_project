itochondria are integral to proper cell function  and mutations in its small genome
 mtdna  are associated with many diseases 
along with the progression of normal aging     
while mtdna has been extensively studied  not
much is known about transcriptional variations of
mitochondrial genes      recently  trna modifications have been the focus of intense study owing to their putative role in diseases      identifying genes responsible for mitochondrial trna
modification is an important step towards a better understanding of transcriptional variation  to
the best of my knowledge  a machine learning approach has never been utilized in order to identify
such genes  here  i used penalized linear regression to predict trna modification activity using
gene expression as features  after controlling for
confounding factors  i was able to predict modification activity at several putative modified trna
positions  these models explained between

introduction
central dogma of biology

mitochondrial punctuation model
independent of nuclear dna  mitochondria have their own
genome  mtdna   which is circular  similar to bacterial
genomes          base pairs long  and contains    genes
which consist of   rrnas     trnas  and    proteins involved with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway  see
figure       mitochondria are not self sufficient and rely
on many proteins encoded by the nuclear genome  when
the mitochondria transcribe the genes located in mtdna 
they produce three polycistronic  transcripts with more
than one gene  mrna sequences where the coding proteins are separated  or punctuated  by trna genes  these
trna  or transfer rna  genes are different from mrna
because they are not translated  but instead trnas aid
in the translation process  by helping ribosomes construct
proteins from amino acids  however  in the mitochondrion 
trnas likely have a second function  scientists hypothesize that the clover like structure of trna regions in the
polycistronic reads serve as a binding site for nuclear encoded cleaving proteins that separate the mitochondrial
genes from the polycistronic read allowing them to continue through the process of translation      given the
importance of trna structure in the punctuation model of
mitochondrial gene translation  it is plausible that modifications of trna structure could affect protein translation
and functional properties of the mitochondrion  in fact 
liu et al   showed that perturbing the editing activity of a
trna modifier protein resulted in defects of mitochondrial
function in cardiomyocytes     
figure    mitochondrial genome  which consists of        bps and
contains    genes 

in       francis crick is credited with first articulating
the flow of sequencing information in a cell known as the
central dogma of biology      essentially  this dogma
states that dna sequence  which serves as data storage 
is transcribed to messenger rna  mrna transcripts  and
later translated into proteins  which are nano scale machines that do most of the functional work in the cell  this
flow of information provides several points in which the
cell can regulate production of protein  the most studied
of which being gene transcription  however  since then scientists have discovered mechanisms by which mrna transcripts are postranscriptionally modified  which can have
downstream effects on protein expression  these kinds of
rna modifications are typically studied in nuclear genes 
and have not been well characterized in mitochondrial
rna transcripts  however  because of the mitochondrions quantifying trna modification
unique mechanism of gene transcription and translation  i
in the last five years there have been significant improvewill argue that certain rna modifications can have signifiments in the technology used to decode dna  dnaseq

fitissue or cell sample  a scientist can decode all the dna
and rna into a human readable format  g c  t  a  and
rna have a special base pair represented as u instead of
t   the output of sequencing are millions of reads that
consist of strings of nucleotide base pairs  typically between
        which represent discrete chunks of molecules of
genetic information  researchers then assemble these reads
like a jigsaw puzzle  reads typically have some overlap between each other   and the number of reads that align to a
specific position in a genome represent the confidence with
which they predict a specific base pair to be located there 
in addition to obtaining decoded genetic information  by
comparing dna sequencing to rna sequencing data  scientists can identify modified rna positions  for example 
if dna sequencing confidently predicts the presence of an
a at a specific position  and rna sequencing instead  but
also confidently  predicts the presence of a g at that same
base pair  then the evidence suggests that after transcription the rna position was modified  hogdkinson et al      
compared mitochondrial dna and rna sequencing data
from a canadian population of nearly      individuals to
identify rna modification events  at eleven positions of
mitochondrial trna  specifically p  positions  they found
systematic significant differences between the dna and
rna predicted base pair  and from this evidence they
hypothesized the presence of a rna modification event at
these positions  to quantify the amount of trna modification  they used the rna sequencing data and calculated
the ratio of read counts that predicted the usual base pair
at that position and the number of reads that predicted
the modified nucleotide  for example  if we look at a read
distributions at one of mitochondrias trna positions  lets
say the dna sequencing data has      reads that align to
a and zero reads that align to the other nucleotides  representing a high likelihood that the position is an adenosine  
however the rna sequencing data at this same position
has     reads aligned to a      reads to c      reads to g 
and     to u  then  a surrogate for the quantity of rna
modification would be the alternative allele frequency  in
our example case 

base pair are more likely to have elevated blood glucose
levels  hodgekinson et al   calculated a rna modification
summary statistic for all the putatively modified trna
positions in each of the nearly      individuals  and then
performed a genome wide association study  gwas  to
identify snp genotypes associated with variations of rna
modification  they found several significant hits  the most
significant hit was located in the mrpp  gene region that
encodes for a protein associated with the mitochondria and
methylation activity 
this work ties trna modification to a biological mechanism  however gwas tend to identify genomic regions of
interest at a low resolution  and it is quite possible that
not all genes responsible for variations of trna modification were identified  instead of performing a gwas 
i utilized a machine learning approach to predict trna
modification values  and identified genes of interest using
feature selection  in this context  my feature matrix will
consist of p protein coding gene expression values for n
observations  and the continuous response variables are the
trna modification summary statistics 

materials   methods
to construct my feature matrix and response variables  i
used data from the genotype tissue expression  gtex 
project  the current data freeze has fastq  sequence read
format  and bam  sequence read format after aligned to
the genome  files located on the stanford genetics department cluster  scg   i analyzed       whole transcriptome
rnaseq samples from     individuals and    different
tissues

the premise is that during rna sequencing  modified bases
are not correctly identified  but instead are stochastically
misread as different nucleotides  with a summary statistic data processing
for trna modification in place we must find a way to
the reads contained in the fastq files are aligned  jigsaw

with blood glucose levels  a gwas is an iterative search
for snps that significantly affect the trait of interest  so
maybe a interesting target would be a gene where individuals that have a g in one of the positions instead of a c

  over millions of years fragments of mtdna have been inserted into

the nuclear genome  these fragments are called nuclear mitochondrial
genes  numts   thus  alignment of the reads to both the nuclear
and mitochondrial genome is important to avoid false mapping of
numt reads to the mitochondria

see figure   for the flow diagram of data processing 
due to quality control concerns  low coverage   i restricted my analysis to only four trna positions       
                     also  i calculated two meta response
variables  one was the average summary statistic for the
four selected trna positions  and the other was mean summary statistic over all the trna positions  including the
low quality base predictions   my gene expression feature
matrix was restricted to protein coding genes  as identified
by gencode annotation  that are differentially expressed
in the samples  i e   the variance of gene expression values
is greater than     this process narrows down the number
of features from over        to        genes 
from the total set of observations i randomly selected
    of the observations  or     samples  to use as a test
set after generating the prediction model  i normalized
both the gene expression values and response variable of
the training set to have a mean of   and variance of   by
subtracting each genes respective mean and dividing by
each each genes respective variance  to normalize the test
data  i centered and scaled the values by the mean and
variance of the training sets respective gene or response
variables mean and variance  this process allows me to
keep the test data independent from the training set and
still normalize the data under the assumption that the
values were produced from the same distribution 
in addition to regressing on the expression values  i controlled for known confounders by performing regression
with gtex metadata  this included metadata such as 
height  weight  gender  age  batch id  samples sequenced
separately could have different qc characteristics   and tissue  which were all located on the scg  server  controlling
for confounding variables is an essential step that removes
extra noise from the signal 

referred to as lasso regression  i chose to use lasso regression  as opposed to ridge regression   set to   resulting
in less sparse solutions  or elastic net   set to between  
and    resulting in coefficient sparsity between lasso and
ridge regression   because i prefer a sparser solution  lasso
tends to shrink coefficients to     and accuracy gains made
by varying  were minimal  models were evaluated by
calculating the mean square error  mse  between the prediction and the response variable  and relying on variance
explained as a metric for determining the amount of signal
captured  calculated by

where y is the original response and y is the regression

controlling for covariates
originally  my model explained trna modification as a
function of gene expression and random standard gaussian
distributed noise or
y  expression   
however  this does not take into account known covariates
that could confound the signal  to identify metadata
correlated with the response variable  i modified my model
so that trna modification is a result of a linear function
of batch id  tissue  gene expression and random standard
gaussian distributed noise or
y  batch   tissue   expression   
the other metadata values did not have much predictive
power so they were excluded  to observe the quantity
of signal loss  i first ran regression on the metadata then
regressed the gene expression values on the residuals 
tissue specific models

regularized linear regression
since the number of features  approximately        differentially expressed protein coding genes  far outnumbers
the number of observations        gtex rnaseq samples   linear regression is not feasible  instead  i used
the glmnet package in r which implements a mixture of
l  and l  penalized linear regression by optimizing the
following objective function 

in an attempt to minimize the amount of signal lossage
when i regress out tissue specific effects  i generated several models  separately  using only the more numerous
single tissue types  specifically  i generated models using
observations from brain  skin  blood  and muscle  of which
there were                and     respective samples  once
again  i held out     for testing  in the results section

effects of a noisy response variable under the assumption of
a latent variable model  as described in      this method
effectively balances the tradeoff between low test error rate
from supervised pca and sparse lasso solutions     
the first step of this method is to run supervised principal components  which is implemented in the superpc
package in r   briefly  this consists of calculating univariate
regression coefficients for each of the normalized features 
and then for several monotonically increasing threshold
values  we calculate the first m principal components  pcs 
on a subset feature matrix consisting of all variables with
larger absolute value univariate coefficients than the specified threshold  going through the list of thresholds iteratively   and using these pcs in a regression model to
predict the outcome  threshold values and m are selected
using cross validation 
after we select the m most significant pcs  constructed
from features with coefficients greater than the selected
threshold value   we generate a predicted response variable
from all the training set observations  and finally run lasso
 with all the features  to try and predict the response
variables generated with supervised pca 

averaged response  we see a dramatic decrease in linearity after controlling for confounding factors  figure  a to
b   while controlling for batch is obviously beneficial  i
hypothesized that some of the noise removed when i controlled by tissue also removed some of the signal  thus 
i created several models using single tissues  which  are
more genetically homogenous  figure   shows the results
of generating a model using     muscle samples  notice
that from  c to  d  we see that less signal is lost  however
the r  values are quite low  this is likely the case because
there are simply not enough training observations 
training set size analysis
to explore this idea further  i generated lasso models predicting the top   base pair averaged response using increasing numbers of observations as a training set and testing
on a fixed test set of     observations  figure   shows
the results of    replicate runs over    different training
set values  as the number of training set observations increases  we see that the training set and test set mean error
converge  however they both plateau at approximately     
for the previous muscle tissue analysis  the model would
be towards the left side of figure    thus explaining the lack
of an appropriate fit

regularized regression   controlling for covariates
   

the first training and test set error rates were calculated
using a model generated with batch id and tissue metadata
information  while the second set was calculated using the
residuals after controlling for tissue and batch  see table    
metadata was best able to explain trna modification
at position        and least capable at position       
strangely  the latter position had a lower test error rate
than training error rate  for most of the positions there
was a disparity between the metadata predicted training
and testing error rate  signifying that there was still some
overfitting occurring  this could be the case because batch
id is a categorical variable and it is possible that there
were not enough samples in a single batch to form a useful
model 
after removing batch and tissue effect confounding  we
see more modest decreases in error rate  columns labeled
with   in table     the biggest decrease in error rate was
at position       for both the training set and the test
set  however  once again there was a disparity between
training and test set error

preconditioned lasso
each of the models i described previously had  on average 
    features  even though i chose lasso for its tendency to
produce sparse solutions  for predicting the amount of
trna modification this is fine  however for gene validation
i need a method of reducing or ranking these genes of
interest to something more manageable  for this reason  i
ran preconditioned lasso 
after removing batch and tissue effects  running preconditioned lasso using the top   base pair average response
resulted in a training error rate of     and a test error rate
of      from a model with only four gene features  while
this method did not produce as low of a training error rate 
the disparity with the test error decreased significantly  a
sign of less overfitting  in addition  four gene features is a
manageable list of interesting genes  the four genes were
 in decreasing order of model coefficient size   alkbh
