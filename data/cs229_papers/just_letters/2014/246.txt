abstract  
the  quantified  self  is  a  movement  to  use  technology  to  collect  data  on  various  aspects  of  a  person s  
life   like   physical   activity    nutrition    sleep    mental   state    productivity   etc    as   mobile   devices   and  
sensors  get  smaller  and  cheaper   its  getting  easier  to  collect  a  lot  of  such  information   the  goal  of  
this  project  is  to  see  if  we  can  find  a  correlation  between  this  data  and  the  person s  mood   
  

  

introduction  

  
there   has   been   an   explosion   of   health   tracking   devices   in   the   past   few   years    devices   like   the   fitbit  
and  jawbone  up  allow  one  to  track  many  aspects  of  their  life  such  as  the  total  steps  taken  during  
the  day   calories  burned   sleep  quality   heart  rate  etc   health  tracking  apps  have  become  a  big  part  
of  all  the  major  mobile  operating  systems   android  fit     and  apple  healthkit         
the  quantified  self  movement  however   is  not  new   people  like  stephen  wolfram     and  nicholas  
felton     have  been  tracking  this  kind  of  data  for  decades  but  mostly  with  a  goal  of  using  this  data  
for   interesting   visualizations    in   this   project    i   try   to   use   some   of   this   data   to   see   how   well   it  
correlates  with  overall  mood well being   

  

dataset  

  
a   personal   data   set   that   was   collected   over   a   period   of       year   was  used   it  contains       data  points   
    data   point   per   day    i   collected   part   of   this   data   by   setting   up   a   script   that   sends   me   an   e mail   with  
a  survey  each  night   it  has  information  about  my  physical  activity   productivity   mood    time  spent  
on  leisure  activities music   etc   some  information  was  also  extracted  from  sources  like  last fm      
moves     and  github   the  features  extracted  were   
 workouts  
 productivity  
 music    
 sleep    
 walking distance   steps   calories  
 running distance   calories  
 cycling distance   calories  
 total calories burnt

methodology  

    

first  look  

to  get  an  initial  sense  of  what  the  data  looked  like   i  tried  principal  component  analysis  and  
isometric  mapping   there  were  no  obviously  separable  components

regression  

  
there  were  two  main  models  that  were  used  to  regress  over  the  mood  based  on  the  extracted  
features    multiple  linear  regression  and  support  vector  regression   support  vector  regression  
was  implemented  with  several  different  kernels    linear   polynomial  and  rbf     the  lowest  testing  
error  was  achieved  with  support  vector  regression  with  the  rbf  kernel   each  of  these  models  
were  tested  with  kfold  cross  validation

     e     
         
  

    

recursive  feature  elimination  

recursive  feature  elimination  with  cross  validation  was  used  to  evaluate  what  features  were  most  
important  in  the  feature  set   the  algorithm  picked       the  top     being     sleep   walking  distance   
total  calories  burnt   git  commits  and  music  playcount

conclusion  

the  lowest  error  was  achieved  using  svms  with  a  rbf  kernel   however   this  testing  error  had  a  
very  low  corresponding  training  error  which  suggests  over fitting   it  was  interesting  to  see  through  
recursive  feature  elimination  that  features  like  sleep   walking  distance   total  calories  burnt   git  
commits  and  music  playcount  were  strongly  correlated  with  mood   
  

  

future  work  

theres  certainly  a  lot  of  room  for  improvement   a  large  part  of  this  is  collecting  more  accurate  data  
and  minimizing  self logged  data  as  much  as  possible   it  will  also  be  great  to  have  data  from  multiple  
people     the  human  memome  project   s  dataset  could  be  interesting  to  dig  into   the  biggest  
challenge  is  getting  consistent  data  from  multiple  people  over  the  same  period  of  time   another  
interesting  approach  would  be  to  look  at  machine  learning  algorithms  for  time series  data  to  
predict  trends  in  mood
