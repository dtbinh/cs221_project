abstract single molecule fluorescence microscopy has been
greatly successful in understanding biophysics at molecular level  this technique has been advancing toward higher
throughput  which creates a need for a data analysis tool to
distinguish molecule of interest from other fluorescence signals 
here  we have used supervised machine learning approaches
to filter biological events of our interest  and present three
approaches applicable to different data set size 

i  introduction
single molecule biophysics has led a stride in understanding biological mechanism at the most fundamental
level  with an aid of recently developed single molecule
techniques  we can now measure forces exerted by conformation change in a single molecule  distances between target
molecules  and hybrid approaches to measure both simultaneously      among various techniques  a single molecule
fluorescence microscopy  smfm  method measures molecular dynamics for many molecules simultaneously  each
smfm experiment usually yields a time course data for
many fluorescing molecule within a microscope field of view 
since many aspects of biology can be modeled through
stochastic model  higher throughput of each experiment leads
to a high accuracy in measurements for dynamic parameters 
smfm has a versatile utility to be used in understanding many biological mechanisms  one of such area is a
translation  a process carried out by a ribosome that decode messenger rna  mrna  to synthesize protein in all
organisms      during translation  ribosome needs to move
through mrna from one codon  three mrna bases that are
mapped to one amino acid of long protein chain  to the
other through series of small steps  ribosomes carry out
these steps through corresponding conformation  by using
a labeled ribosome to probe this conformational change
through the intensity of fluorescence signal  puglisi and
coworkers discovered underlying mechanisms of canonical
and non canonical decoding by ribosome        
since dynamic for each steps of translation are probabilistic  a large number of sample is needed to provide accurate
measurements  recently  the puglisi lab has utilized zeromode waveguides technology to improve a throughput of
assay from order of       to              as a throughput
of assay increases  a need to filter unwanted signal and
retain molecules of interest arises  with a small number of
observed molecules  it is possible to visually pick signals
that are corresponding to biological event based on control

experiments  however  in the order of        to        
molecules per experiment  manual data processing becomes
quickly infeasible  using machine learning approach  an
automated data processing can increase the throughput of
data processing  since a classification label for each molecule
is easily provided by visual inspection  we used supervised learning algorithms to take advantage of an accessible
information  after quick implementations  we found three
different algorithms that can be used to maximally help filter
out unwanted data depending on the size of experiment 
ii  method
a  smfm experimental setup for acquiring dataset
for each experiment  one end of mrna strand    end 
was labeled with biotin and immobilized on the microscope slide surface containing neutravidin through biotinneutravidin chemistry  a ribosome small subunit    s  was
labeled with cy b  green fluorescing molecular dye   and
formed pre initiation complex  pic  before experiment  after
the start of data acquisition through charge coupled device
 ccd  camera  a ribosome large subunit labeled with bhq   quencher molecule corresponding to cy b  along with
necessary elongation factors were injected into a microscope
slide  during the translation of mrna  small and large subunit of ribosome undergoes series of conformation changes
that can be monitored through intensity level of cy b     
        
b  preprocessing of data
to train and test  we preprocessed raw imaging data
resulted from four experiments  and used two for training
and two for testing  during experiment  fluorescently labeled
ribosomes were immobilized on a surface of microscope
slide  and illuminated by one laser  movie was collected
using ccd camera after optically filtering out excitation
laser  due to spreading of the fluorescence spots from each
image  we identify each spot and sum up over   by   pixels
 fig       then  we calculate the background of the image to
remove  and scale a signal from each molecule from   to     
in a final data structure  we get an m by n matrix with m to
be a number of frames  usually    frame per seconds and
      frames for     seconds movie   and n to be number
of molecules recorded     
c  feature selection
to select appropriate features  we visually labeled data
used for training and testing  and separated out wanted
and unwanted signal for each data  then  we compared

ficomparing their performance 
we visualized features to see that used features induce
two different distribution for wanted and unwanted signal 
and therefore used features are indeed relevent  fig

fig

preprocessing   bottom  gradient of signal calculated convolving with
prewitt filter  time was cut off at     seconds to increase visual resolution
of underlying structure within signal 

fig     preprocessing of data  we obtain a movie from the microscope 
and look for a fluorescence spot for an immobilized molecule  after
preprocessing steps detailed in text  we extract a scaled time course signal
for each molecules   top  this panel shows a signal from wanted molecule 
which has three intensity states  the first state  blue horizontal line  signifies
before the assembly of full translation complex  the second state  red line 
signifies waiting of transfer rna  trna  to decode mrna information 
and the third state  purple line  corresponds to the binding of trna and
conformation change of ribosome to decode and synthesize protein with
adding one amino acid per a codon at a time  top arrows show where
specific events happen   bottom  this is raw image acquired using our
experimental setup 

distribution of each features between wanted and unwanted
data to choose    features in total  for the first two  we
simply calculated average and variance of signal  for the
rest of eight features  we used differentiation of signal to
identify rapid change in signal  which we achieved through
convolution using a prewitt filter well used for edge detection in one dimensional image  fig           for the third
feature  we looked for when a minimum value within the
first     frames     seconds  occurs  which corresponds to
the assembly of a whole translational decoding complex after
the start of the experiment  for the fourth feature  we looked
for when maximum value within    frames    seconds  after
a fall in signal occurs  for the fifth feature  we looked for
when minimum value within    frames after a surge in
signal occurs  and for the sixth feature  we looked for when
maximum value within    frames occur after the second fall 
for the last four features  we used means and variances
of gradient of the signal for whole     seconds and for
    seconds  we have optimized each features crudely by

d  supervised learning
then  we have used supervised learning package built in
matlab software  mathworks  for support vector machine  svm  model and naive bayes  nb  model  to compare with a non supervising method  we also implemented
exclusion  ex  method  for this method  we looked for
a maximum and a minimum value for each feature from
training set and retained test samples in which falls within
these ranges  this method was also provided a baseline for
maximizing true positive  retaining a good molecule from
the set  accuracy  which has an increasing importance in a
smaller data set  we also devised another hybrid method
of a majority voting  mv   which compares results from
three method mentioned  svm  nb and ex   and follow a
majority decision for all molecules 
iii  results
using    features derived from       molecules of      
frame time course data  we achieved at least    percent
accuracy in labeling using any methods for the two criteria 
true positive accuracy  tp  labeling of wanted molecule to
be wanted  and true negative accuracy  tn  labeling of
unwanted molecule to be unwanted   for       test molecules
and       training molecules  each method used has different
trade off between tp and tn accuracy  using nb  we could
filter out up to    percent of the unwanted test data by
losing up to    percent of wanted data  using svm  we
could retain around    percent of wanted data  comparable
to ex method  while successfully filtering out    percent
of unwanted data  we also changed regularization parameter

fig     feature validation  for each features  distribution of features of
wanted and unwanted signals are compared to see relevence of used feature
for classification  in this figure  we compared first two features on top two
histograms  and last two features on bottom two histograms 

for svm  which resulted in trade off between retaining of
wanted data and filtering of unwanted data  ex method was
good at retaining data      percent   but not great in filtering
     percent   as we have expected  performance of mv
method resulted compromise between svm and nb  with   
percent retaining and    percent filtering  we have also tried
other hybrid schemes with different weighting from three
methods  but their performances were similar to presented
four methods here  in the end  we have three methods with
distinctive performance that can be used depending on the
size of data

iv  discussion
simple implementation of a supervised machine learning
approach performed considerably well  with one particular method resulting in nearly    percent filtering  since
each step of ribosome conformation changes is distributed
exponentially  a boundary between wanted and unwanted
data is not a clear cut  due to this inseparable nature of
data  a visual recognition method using neural networks
would have required a huge set of training data  in our
method  training data set size did not matter much  although
with a larger training set resulted in the stabilization of the
performance  other machine learning approaches such as the
k mean clustering or pca would have not performed as well 
as the structure of signal is probabilistically distributed and
preprocessing using scaling would have resulted in very different temporal structure as well as structure in intensity level
for each ribosome conformation  leading to a continuous
distribution of time course signal  the supervised learning
algorithm utilized labeling information resulted from visual
inspection and features designed to match visual processing
of data  which was the most reasonable and appropriate for
this project 
approaching the problem with multiple methods within a
supervised learning and combining results  we have achieved
three different policies that can be used depending on the
size of the data set  if a data set size is in a scale of
       or more molecules  the most aggressive method of
nb would filter out most of the unwanted data  in general 
for        molecules  around       are not wanted and
      are wanted  and     wanted molecules give a good
estimate of kinetic parameters within experiment   while
giving enough wanted molecules to be analyzed further for
accurate measurements  for the data set size of        the
most conservative method  svm  would retain most of the
wanted data while filtering more than    percent of unwanted
data  for the data set size in between       to         a
hybrid approach of mv would result in a good balance
between filtering and retaining 

fig     result from learning  we used       molecules for training and
      molecules for testing  training and testing showed similar trend with
respect to training data size and for each methods used  nb method is the
best in classifying unwanted molecule  and svm is the best in classifying
wanted molecule  in general  there is trade between retaining and filtering
accuracy  which is conceptually correct  more aggresive the filter is  it will
likely to filter out wanted material as well  ex method seems to be similar
in retaining ability with svm  for testing set   but svm is better at filtering 
excluding ex method  we present three methods  nb  svm  mv  to be
used in different circumstances depending on the size of data set and how
aggressive filtering we want it to be

v  conclusions
in this project  we implemented supervised learning approach to automate data processing in a single molecule

fiexperiment  extracting relevent features from time course
data required imagination and logical steps in recognizing
wanted shape in one dimensional signal  using ten of such
features  we have presented three different models that can
be used in data processing of certain data set sizes 
vi  future
in a future endeavor  increasing feature spaces with finding
more relevant features might improve overall performance 
our next goal is to improve retaining to    percent  while
filter out nearly    percent  which can be used in practical
setting immediately independent of data set size
