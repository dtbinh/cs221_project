cs    final project report

biological concentrations  the goal to be accomplished is to be able to discern between naturallycontaminated soil samples and unnaturallycontaminated soil samples  if the samples can be
consistently classified  a geographical mapping of
the unnatural  i e  man made  contamination locations may help to determine the source s  of contamination 

abstract  soil pollution is can be considered to
be an imbalance of chemicals in the soil at a particular site  such unnatural contamination must be addressed to avoid hazard to the environment and inhabitants of a polluted site  however  it is important
to first be able to identify whether a site is contaminated before determining a solution  this paper explores the classification of soil samples at a particular
site  mcconnell air force base  to investigate the
natural or unnatural contamination of soil  the samples are addressed using k means clustering  k fold
cross validation  and gaussian discriminant analysis 
from these evaluations  contamination at the site of
interest can be considered 

   data set
the samples taken from mcconnell air force
base were tasted in a laboratory for concentrations of eighteen metals  aluminum  arsenic  barium  beryllium  calcium  total chromium  cobalt 
copper  iron  lead  magnesium  manganese 
mercury  nickel  potassium  sodium  vanadium 
and zinc  the     samples were also mapped to
geographic locations around the site  allowing for
postliminary contamination assignments 

   introduction
soil contamination is characterized by solid or liquid hazardous substances mixed with naturally
occurring soil  soil pollution can arise from a number of sources  which could be both naturallyoccurring in soil and man made  in other words 
the ratio of chemicals in the soil of a given site
may be attributed to both natural and unnatural
accumulation or production of compounds due to
specific environmental conditions  these contaminants can adversely impact the health of plants 
animals  and humans when directly or indirectly
coming into contact with contaminated soil  due
to the detrimental nature of contamination and the
multiple methods to address soil pollution  it is of
key interest to be able to determine whether specific sites have contaminated soil 

   features and preprocessing
due the wide range of various concentrations in
the dataset  the log distributions of the concentrations were analyzed to scale and compare soil
components  the features were assumed to be
gaussian  the log normal distributions are provided in figure   
for subsequent analysis  the means and standard
deviations of the metal components are present in
figure    furthermore  the geographic locations of
each soil sample on the site have been provided in
figure   

soil contaminants may vary in both location and
type  in this report  the scope of the soil contamination is limited to soil samples taken from the
mcconnell air force base  the components investigated in the soil samples are fixed as non

the dataset was first grouped assuming that there
were two clusters and analyzed for consistency 
these two clusters would represent naturally
contaminated soil samples and unnaturally contaminated soil samples  the datasets were subsequently grouped with the assumption that three
or more clusters were present  these clustercentroids would also represent different types of
contamination and potentially different sources of
contamination 
the features were investigated to determine a hierarchy of significance  the importance of a metal
with respect to its impact on classification was
evaluated by comparing the standard deviation of
the lognormal concentration spread to the distance between the centroids at that feature  the
closer the concentrations at the centroids  the less
important it was deemed to be

fiby determining the order of importance in the features  it would be possible to establish key features that influence the contamination classification of a given soil sample  from a different perspective  it opens the possibility that certain features are not necessary  removing non important
features greatly simplifies computation for future
analyses 

ples   furthermore  the centroids were consistently
generated  this regularity in results strongly suggests the existence of two classes of contamination samples 
however  when using k means clustering to identify three or four distinct clusters  the resulting
classifications were not unique  specifically  kmeans clustering was not able to converge to the
same set of clusters given random centroid initialization  it is unlikely that more than two types of
contamination exist within the given dataset  there
is a strong implication that there is a single source
of contamination on the site  given the lack of uniformity in classification assignments  gaussian discriminant analysis was not reasonable and was
not further explored for more than two classifications 

    k fold cross validation
samples were randomly grouped into    subsets
of    samples  this method allows for contamination predictions on the given dataset without requiring additional samples from the field  the randomness also provides variation in the training
sets for the subsequent gaussian discriminant
analysis 
an extreme version of k fold cross validation was
also explored  the jackknife resampling method 
using this method  an algorithm is trained on the
entire dataset  save for a single sample  the algorithm is subsequently tested on the sample to determine effectiveness of training

    gaussian discriminant analysis
using the assignments from k means clustering 
linear discriminant analysis was used to generate a
predictor for potential future samples to be taken
from the site  the performance for linear discriminant analysis  lda  was compared to the performance for quadratic discriminant analysis  qda  
for a given cross validation set  predictions were
made both using the assumption that the variances between naturally and unnaturally contaminated samples are equal  the accuracy of the
resulting indication is then compared to the accuracy of the prediction made without assuming
equal variance

the trend seems to imply that the addition of certain features do not significantly aid in the classification process of the dataset  i e  where the lines
are relatively flat   however  running k means on
the set without those features does not provide an
accurate representation of the classifications

from this data  it is apparent that the unnaturally
contaminated soil samples have significantly higher concentrations of metals such as barium  mercury  and lead 

it is interesting to note that  for this particular dataset  the jackknife resampling method boosted
the accuracy of linear discriminant analysis predictions and decreased the accuracy of quadratic
discriminant analysis predictions  furthermore 
usage of the jackknife resampling method did not
appear to influence positive or negative predictions of naturally contaminated soil samples  it only
affected predictions of unnaturally contaminated
soil samples 

to explore the impact of the features on the classifications  k means clustering was performed on
the samples with reduced features  features were
removed in order of increasing importance until
the most significant feature was left to classify
the dataset  in each case  the same centroids
were repeatedly generated 

although the jackknife resampling method provides small improvements to the linear and quadratic discriminant analyses  generating the predictions also took considerably longer  for significantly larger datasets  the tradeoff may be less
favorable  likewise  for smaller datasets  the jackknife resampling method could be a worthwhile
investment 
regardless of the sampling for training and testing  quadratic discriminant analysis consistently
performed better than linear discriminant analysis 
this outcome is expected because the quadratic
discriminant analysis operates on fewer assumptions  i e  shared variance  than linear discriminant
analysis

   conclusion

after establishing the classification of the data set 
the contamination sites were mapped  k means
was executed on both the original concentrations
 figure    and the log normal  figure    concentrations 

from the analyses of the data with respect to
classification  it can be stated with high confidence that the mcconnell air force base has apparent soil contamination  this contamination is
characterized by especially high concentrations of
barium  mercury  and lead  the source of the
contamination is yet unknown  given the provided
data  but may be related to depth of soil sample
or specific site operations 

   future endeavors
classification of soil sample contamination is one
that is constantly undergoing change  most available data uses hierarchical classification to determine clusters of samples  along with principal
component analysis 
in future work  i would like to investigate the accuracy of hierarchical classifications  using either
principal component analysis  pca  or independent component analysis  ica   these reductions
primarily differ in the assumption of gaussian features  or lack thereof  i would like to compare the
classifications from those strategies and models to
those achieved from k means  as done in this report

as seen in figures   and    there is no clear geographical basis for the clustering of natural or unnatural contamination  therefore  the source of the
contamination cannot be determined from the
provided data
