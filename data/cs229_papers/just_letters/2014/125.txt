what can we learn from the accelerometer data 
a close look into privacy
team member  devu manikantan shila
abstract  a handful of research efforts nowadays focus on gathering and analyzing the data from the
end devices such as wearables  smart phones to understand various user patterns and then customize
their solutions based on the identified user patterns  e g   health care industries monitors the walking
pattern of the patients for early disease diagnosis   a key question is  what else could we learn from the
data besides the activity pattern   the objective of this project is to apply state of the art
art machine learning
techniques on the raw activity  aka gait  data collected from the wearable devices  chest mounted
accelerometer and also accelerometer mounted at multiple body locations  to recognize the   user  
performing the specific activity  the proposed approach is based on a multi layer    layer 
layer  classification
problem   a  in the first layer  we will identify the gait  irrespective of the user  and map into the most
probable gait label   b  in the second layer  we will identify the user with regard to the identified gait with
a certain level of confidence  this project leverages supervised learning techniques such as adaboost 
svm  knn  random forest trees  nb for the multi layer classification problem  for the experiments  the
datasets from uci repository    
       were employed  the dataset mainly consists of the raw tri axial
tri
acceleration  acceleration measured in three spatial dimensions x  y and z   the three dimensional data
mainly captures the acceleration of the persons body  gravity  external forces like vibration of the
accelerometer device and sensor noise  these characteristics may vary from one activity  or user  to
another and serve as a useful measure for distinguishing users and activities  the experiment
experime results
showed that random forest and adaboost performed well with identifying activities  accuracy
 
of    
for dataset   and     for dataset    and users   accuracy of     for datasets
tasets   and     we envision that
this research project will have two key advantages  first  design a machine learning based technique for
recognizing users based on the gait rather than relying on biometrics  fingerprints  facial  voice  or
passwords pins  second  enables researchers to think in a new direction  should we randomize or
anonymize data in such a manner only the gait pattern can be learned without violating  leaking  the user
privacy 
approach  the proposed effort mainly encompasses
three components   a  data gathering
ring   identifying the
right dataset to use for gait and user classification

models and training the data on the training set and
validating using test set   the figure to the right
shows our approach graphically 
data gathering  we used the publicly available datasets from the uci repository    
       two datasets
were used to confirm our findings related to gait activity based user recognition   dataset     is obtained
from the wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest     and  dataset     is obtained from the wearable
accelerometer mounted on four body locations  waist  left thigh  right arm and right ankle       dataset  

fi    the original dataset from     is collected from    participants     files  each belonging to a
participant   performing seven activities  working at computer  standing up  walking and going up
down stairs  standing  walking  going up down stairs  walking and talking with someone  talking while
standing   due to intensive computing requirements  we used the data belonging to    participants  files  
each participant file consists of the following information  sequential number  x acceleration  y
acceleration  and z acceleration and activity labels  the total number of samples per file  row  differs and
ranges from    k to    k and the number of dimensions  columns  is    excluding gait labels   the
sampling frequency of the accelerometer is   hz   dataset       the dataset consists of    feature vector
with time and frequency domain variables corresponding to tri axial accelerations from four parts of the
body  the real size of the dataset is    k and each file consists of the following information  user 
gender  age  height  weight  bmi     feature vector  there are total of   activities  sitting  walking  sitting
down  standing and standing up   the sampling frequency of the accelerometer was assumed to be   hz 
feature extraction  the dataset consists of raw tri axial accelerometer data and hence one may need to
extract the useful features from this raw data to help identify the gait and the user performing the gait  the
raw acceleration signals were first pre processed by applying noise filters and are then separated into
parts of several seconds using a fixed width sliding window approach with       overlapping
rectangular windows  using   seconds sliding window and sampling frequency of       hz  we have
        readings window   alternatively  original signal of length l is divided into segments of length t 
and we used a length of   seconds for t  based on literature review  observed that we need to capture at
least   second signal to extract the gait and corresponding user signature accurately   the segments at
this stage are still represented as time series and hence  features are required to be extracted for each  second window  for dataset    and dataset     we extracted    and    statistical features  respectively 
using the following metrics  rms  root mean square of the x  y and z signal   signal correlation
coefficient  correlation between xy  yz and xz signals   cross correlation  similarity between two
waveforms   fft  maximum and minimum of fast fourier transforms   vector magnitude  signal and
differential vector magnitude   maximum  minimum  binned distribution  relative histogram distribution
in linear spaced bins between the minimum and the maximum acceleration in the segment   zero crossings
 number of sign changes in the window  and information entropy  a recommended metric to differentiate
between signals that correspond to different activity patterns but similar energy signals   the statistical
signature  feature  extraction module is implemented in matlab 
machine learning models  as mentioned earlier  the proposed approach consists of two phases   a  gait
recognition   b  user recognition based on the gait  therefore  we call this approach as a two layer multiclassification problem  where given the statistical features extracted from the   second test data sample 
the model shall be able to identify the gait of the person and then use that results to identify the person
performing the specific gait  before training the model using the machine learning algorithms  the
preprocessed datasets         are partitioned into two sets   a  activity training set  xtrain with feature
vectors and ytrain with activity labels   b  user training set for each activity  xtrain with features
and ytrain with user label performing a particular activity  to avoid the problem of over fitting  each
training set is further partitioned into testing and training data using the cross validation package from
python scikit  we have evaluated three cases  holding out          and     of the data for testing
 evaluating  our classifiers  we used knn  adaboost  svm  random forest trees and nave bayes
algorithms for the classification purpose  our experiments showed that the nave bayes performed worst
with     testing accuracy score and so  the results corresponding to nave bayes are omitted from the
tables and the discussion below  all the models were implemented in python using the scikit machine

filearning library  the performance of algorithms on recognizing gait and users was independently
measured using confusion matrices  enabled us to extract the features that will distinguish two classes  
testing accuracy  f  score  the observations  accuracy and f  scores  are given below for each dataset 
optimal parameters for classifiers  table     shows the parameters used for the classification
algorithms  for instance  we used a radial basis
function  rbf  kernel for svms and a
parameter selection using grid search from the
pythons gridsearchcv package giving the
combination of c   and gamma         
similarly  for random forest  adaboost and knn  table    optimal classifier parameters used for the experiments
using sckit learn  we found the optimal values for
the parameters n estimators  n neighbors by looping through a range of values and calculating the
accuracy based on the holdout data  furthermore  for knn  we used a uniform weighing function that
gives equal importance for all the neighboring k points  besides parameter estimators  tree based feature
selection algorithm from sklearn ensemble package was used to disregard irrelevant features by
computing feature importances and to improve our running time  though the tree based selection
algorithm produced low dimensional features      dimension reduction  for both dataset     and     we
found that using the reduced set of features corresponded to lower classification performance     drop in
accuracy scores  for random forest classifier  throughout our experiments  no feature selection
algorithms were employed

 almost all classifiers produced the same behavior   for further reasoning of the results  we used the f

random forest gave user identification accuracy of      to     a close observation of activity   shows
that it is a combination of several activities such as standing up  walking  going up down stairs etc and
that may be one of the reason the classifiers were unable to identify it properly

in short  the user classification performed very well compared to the activity classification and regarding
the classifiers  random forest and adaboost
performed the best  one reason for the worst
performance of activity classifier  classes   
  and    will be the inaccuracy of the activity
data itself  as said earlier  some activities are
combinations of   or more activities   other
reasoning behind this observation may be the
in sufficient information provided by the
single chest mounted accelerometer  this figure    testing accuracy of activity classification for cv splits

future work  in future  we would like to apply unsupervised learning techniques such as mixture of
gaussians and also  extract more useful features such as the speed  acceleration signal signs to improve
the classification rates in a less user
