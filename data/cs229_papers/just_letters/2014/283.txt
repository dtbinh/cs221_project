introduction

the human genome project   completed in       opened the door for big data approaches to studying
mendelian disorders   in the decade since  hundreds of millions of dollars have gone towards funding
genome wide association studies   gwas   which have yielded interesting results but have almost
completely failed at actually explaining the genetic basis of any diseases   because of monetary
constraints  most gwas only consider approximately     million commonly occurring mutations seen on
snp arrays  in order to avoid the costs of sequencing all   billion base pairs in the genome  because
researchers in the field are slowly abandoning gwas  much of this snp array data is now ignored as
people see more promise in cutting edge techniques such as next generation sequencing  
congenital heart defects  chd  are an example of a disease for which gwas was only able to explain a
small percentage of cases  chd continues to be the most common birth defect in the united states 
affecting almost    of live births  and increasing in prevalence as time passes   in this project we set out
to salvage results from forgotten snp arrays for chd patients by building a classifier that predicts
whether a patient has a congenital heart defect based on his or her genome sequence at     million snps  
because the diagnosis of chd upon birth is fairly good  achieving      classifier accuracy is not critical
here  instead  our main goal is to identify a minimal feature set of loci  locations in the genome  that
warrant further biological investigation as potentially causal agents of chd  this is a challenging
problem that many researchers have approached in various forms  and any progress would be considered
notable in its own right  in order to avoid potentially missing some interesting signal that past researchers
have overlooked  we consciously try to minimize the amount of false negatives emitted by our classifier 

 

methods

    data preprocessing
the human genome is full of noisy components that can potentially confound our analysis  in order to
maintain confidence that any results we find actually reflect a genetic link to congenital heart defects  we
take a couple steps to control for confounding variables 
      segmentation of patients by ethnic group
ethnic differences between patients are very easily detected in the genome  if the genetic makeup of the
positive and negative class individuals differs in any way  a classifier on this data would easily be able to
attain high accuracy simply by giving high weight to the variants that differ between the racial groups 
this classifier would not learn anything useful about chd  to control for this  we group all chd infants
by ethnicity  as reported by their parents at the time of the study  we choose to focus on the largest ethnic
group  white infants with chd  consisting of    individuals 
      introduction of negative class via the thousand genomes project
we now seek negative class samples with a couple key requirements  first  these patients should be
healthy individuals who do not have any form of chd  second  these patients must be ethnically similar
to our positive class samples  so that the classifier does not simply learn to detect ethnic differences 
third  we must be able to access genotype data for these individuals at the same     million snps that we
have for the positive class patients 

 

snp  pronounced snip  stands for single nucleotide polymorphism  a     million snp array surveys patient genotypes at    
million locations in the genome at which a mutation is common  we say that a patient has a snp if he or she has the common
mutation at that particular location 

fiwe notice that all of these requirements appear to be satisfied by the     individuals in the     
genomes project  who are of european descent  to confirm that our positive and negative class are
ethnically similar  we performed a principal components analysis as shown in figure   below 
figure    principal components analysis of positive class samples
and negative class samples  who we assume to all be white
individuals  in addition to asian and african individuals from the
     genomes project  since the positive and negative class
samples cluster together by race  but separately from the other two
races  this is an indication that racial factors will not confound our
classifier 

    feature selection
as our primary goal is to identify a minimal feature set that still achieves reasonable classification
accuracy on the data  feature selection is the key problem in this project 
      reduction of feature set using domain knowledge
prior gwas studies have already attempted to identify snps that may be relevant to chd  the intent of
this project is to improve on those studies  not to recreate them  prior efforts in the bejerano lab have
identified a list of      snps over    biological pathways that we believe may be relevant to chd 
therefore we immediately reduce our feature set to these      snps and set out to identify key snps
within these pathways  it is not uncommon in genetics for a handful of snps to cause a large change in
phenotype 
      filter feature selection
we implement filter feature selection using two separate metrics  one of which integrates domain
knowledge of genetics 
        filtering by mutual information  mi 
in this version of filter feature selection  we calculate the mutual information of every snp with respect
to the output variable  disease or no disease  and select the top n snps as our feature set  where n is a
threshold that we determine 
        filtering by transmission disequilibrium test  tdt  score
the transmission disequilibrium test   detects alleles that are in linkage disequilibrium in a population
of patients with a particular disease  lets define a and a to be the major  common  and minor  mutation 
alleles  respectively  at snp i  if snp i is not associated with chd  then allele transmission at snp i
should be uniformly random according to standard genetic laws  that is  we should see that parents with
genotype aa at snp i should be equally likely to transmit either allele  a or a  to their chd offspring 
however  if allele a at snp i is strongly linked to chd  we would expect to see not uniformly random
transmission at snp i  but rather a preponderance of transmission of allele a at this snp 
at snp i we look at the genotypes of each chd child and their parents in order to determine the specific
allele that each parent transmitted to the child  we then increment one number in the following table for
each parent 
transmitted
allele
a

non transmitted allele
a

c
e

figure      illustration of transmission disequilibrium test 
no information is given by entries b and e in the table since
homozygous parents will always transmit one copy of an allele
and not transmit one copy of the same allele 
 

fithe test then uses a chi squared test with one degree of freedom to test the hypothesis that allele
      

transmission is random at this locus      
  we compute this chi squared statistic at all snps in our
   
feature set and filter by the associated p value 
        filtering by a combination of mutual information and transmission disequilibrium
the most straightforward method of combining two filter feature selection metrics is to chain the
methods by first filtering by one statistic  and then by the other  we also study the correlation of mi and
tdt scores over all snps 
our most effective method examines the overlap of the top n features by mi and the top n features by
tdt  for any threshold n  we choose the n at which the size of the overlap  relative to n  is most
significant when testing against the null hypothesis that tdt and mi are unrelated  we then examine the
snps in this overlap for biological significance and for efficacy as a reduced feature set 
    algorithm selection
after analyzing the performance of several classifiers  including linear regression  logistic regression 
nave bayes  and support vector machines  svm  with various kernels and regularization parameters 
we converged on a regularized svm  penalty coefficient      with a gaussian kernel  we found
empirically that this algorithm did not overfit  and produced the best classifier given our preference for
false positives over false negatives  because we have    cases and     controls  we weight each sample
inversely proportional to class frequency to account for this 

 

results

we now present some of the more notable results that illustrate how feature selection impacts the
performance of our classifier 
    filter feature selection
figure   below shows how classifier accuracy changes as a function of feature set size  interestingly 
classification accuracy is fairly robust to reduced feature set sizes  this may be partially because of
linkage disequilibrium  a known genetic phenomenon that posits that inheritance at nearby loci is closely
linked  therefore  knowing information about only one snp in a region is often sufficient to extrapolate
and obtain information about the remaining snps in that same region of the genome 

figure    classifier accuracy vs  feature set size for top features as determined by mutual information
 left  and transmission disequilibrium test  right  
further investigation shows that using the top    snps by mutual information score as a feature set
results in reasonable accuracy  figure     at any feature set size below     accuracy rapidly decreases 
indicating that each snp being removed from the feature set is critical to classification accuracy 
 

fifigure    zoom in on the mutual information chart
from figure    classification accuracy on a feature
set of size    is reasonable  and accuracy decreases
sharply for each feature that is subsequently removed
from the feature set 

the level of accuracy that the classifier achieves using only    snps is quite high  leading us to ask
questions about the underlying distribution of the mutual information and tdt scores  these distributions
are shown in figure    where it is clear that   snps have much higher mutual information scores than the
rest of the feature set 

figure    distribution of mutual information  left  and tdt  right  scores 
predicting using only the top   snps by mutual information score results in zero classification accuracy
on the positive class  as represented in figure    however  we still seek a slightly smaller feature set  but
without the fall in accuracy that is seen in figure    to solve this problem we explore methods of
combining mutual information and tdt in order to select an even smaller feature set  using the overlap
method discussed in section          we identify that the top    features by mutual information and the
top    features by tdt share   snps in common  and these   snps alone have reasonable predictive
power as a feature set  in fact  a classifier using this feature set of   snps has effectively the same
accuracy on the positive class as a classifier using the top     features by mutual information does  these
results are shown in figure

having identified a set of   features that may be related to chd  our final step is to analyze the
distribution of these   snps in the original    biological pathways that we started with  biological
pathways can share snps  especially if the pathways correspond to similar function  this distribution is
 

fishown in figure    which clearly points to the second and tenth pathways as targets for future
investigation

discussion

by integrating domain knowledge of genetics and genomics with traditional machine learning techniques
we were able to improve on previous results and identify   snps and   biological pathways that warrant
further investigation as potentially causal agents of chd  these links cannot be validated until further
biological experimentation is carried out  if any of these snps or pathways does show a new link to
chd  we will have successfully salvaged new information from data that many researchers have long
forgotten
