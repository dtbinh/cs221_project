introduction

the classification of gene expression profiles for diagnosis and survival outcome prediction
for cancer patients is an important yet challenging task in systems biology  conventional
analysis of gene expression profiles generally succeeds in identifying distinct cancer cell types
as well as healthy tissues  however  the reliable prediction of cancer subtypes and survival
outcome parameters for patients suffering from the same type of cancer remains elusive
because the expression patterns for the majority of genetic markers are not sufficiently distinct  in order to focus on the most informative marker subsets and allow subclassification of
gene expression patterns  novel feature selection techniques for supervised machine learning
methods must be developed  this project aims to address this problem by reconstructing
a gene interaction network from steady state gene expression profiles  characterizing certain
subsets of genes according to their topological properties and verifying these subsets utility
as feature selection filters for a variety of classification algorithms 

 

project description and related work

for cs     the goal of the project was to subject a dataset of        genes and       lung
adenocarcinoma patient samples to a number of supervised machine learning algorithms  e g 
logistic regression  softmax regression and gaussian discriminant analysis  gda  in order to
classify gene expression profiles according to cancer subtype and survival outcome  the brute
force approach was to apply each of the aforementioned learning algorithms to the entire
dataset without feature selection  a more nuanced but nonetheless conventional approach
 

fiwas to adjust the number of features to address the tradeoff between bias and variance 
feature selection was performed by ranking genes according to the correlation between their
expression values and survival outcome parameters  and choosing those with the highest
correlation as machine learning features  for this purpose mutual information  mi  was
used as a correlation measure  both brute force and conventional feature selection were
then tested and compared  the patient dataset was subdivided in a random but balanced
fashion so as to allow training and testing on independent sets  after training each of the
algorithms  test success rates for the different approaches were quantified for each algorithm
and juxtaposed against each other 
for cs    w  the goal was to provide a novel feature selection approach for machine
learning by taking into account the topological properties of the gene interaction network
whose states are described by the aforementioned gene expression profiles  one topological
feature selection approach based on pagerank has been proposed in      in this approach
node j in the gene interaction network is ranked according to the following iteration recipe 
rjn

      d cj   d

n
x
aij rn 
i

i  

ki

where a is the adjacency matrix  ki the degree of node i and cj is the pearson correlation
value of gene j with the output measured in terms of survival time  the parameter d weighs
how much influence is attributed to the pearson correlation with the output and how much
to the topology of the network via pagerank  before a filter is applied  the optimal value of
parameter d must be estimated  this is done by splitting the training set into two subsets
for training and testing purposes  several trials are performed for different values of d and
the value with the best predictive result is chosen 
however  it is not obvious why a high pagerank score should be the determining criterion for feature selection as opposed to some other topological property with a different
value range  it may therefore be worthwhile to choose a different approach and check other
topological node properties for their utility as feature selection parameters  the first step
in this project was to reconstruct the underlying gene interaction network with the network
inference algorithm aracne      this method uses steady state gene expression data to
predict direct interactions between gene pairs based on mi correlation and the data processing inequality  dpi   the adjacency matrix produced by aracne was then processed by
snap to compute a set of p      topological network properties for each node i  these
values were used to embed each node as a coordinate point in a p dimensional space in a
manner similar to that in      subsequently  k means clustering was applied to these embedded points to discover prominent gene clusters in p space  each cluster was then used
as a gene pool for the mi feature selection filter to act upon  the performance of each pool
was measured by applying the machine learning routines to the test set and comparing the
resulting success rates with those of the brute force and the conventional feature selection
approach

dataset

the dataset used in this project represents an agglomeration of clinical data from different
patient groups with lung adenocarcinoma collected over many years  with        genes and
      patients this data set is rather large  given that the usual number of patients used for
machine learning algorithms in cancer biology is an order of magnitude lower  for machine
learning purposes  the dataset was randomly split into a training and a test set of     and
    patients  respectively  such that age  gender and other patient parameters remained
balanced to prevent skewed results due to either of these factors 
the data is comprised of two parts  the first part is a table of gene expression values 
in which rows correspond to genes and columns to patients  sporadically occurring missing
values were imputed with the function knnimpute in matlab using the    nearest neighboring columns as measured by euclidean distance  a standard procedure in bioinformatics 
this adjusted dataset is the starting point for the aracne algorithm from which the adjacency matrix is inferred  for performance reasons  aracne was executed with a set of
one hundred patients  the minimum admissible number for the algorithm to produce a useful
reconstruction of the gene interaction network 
the second part of the dataset consists of a file containing patient ids as rows and
survival parameters and other clinical information as columns  there are two kinds of
survival parameters considered in this project  the first measures the patient status as to
whether the patient is dead or alive after   years  the second measures the cancer subtype 
a multivalued measure assuming the values  i  ii  iii  iv   representing increasing severity
and aggressiveness of the cancer 

 
   

network inference algorithm and other methods
network inference algorithm

in aracne  stationary gene expression profiles are subjected to correlation analysis in order
to infer the probability of direct links between gene pairs  aracne proceeds by examining
all possible pairwise interactions and then deleting all those which do not pass through its
filters  the are two filters 
    mutual information  mi  filter   mi is an information theoretic relatedness measure employed to remove all links  i  j   for which the mutual information estimate i gi   gj     i    i e 
for which the calculated mutual information approximation falls below a certain threshold
i  determined by the user either directly or by setting a p value 
    dpi filter   in order to remove what are likely inferred but non existent direct links 
aracne examines all triangles  gi   gj   gk   and  using the data processing inequality  dpi 
i g    g     min i g    g     i g    g      marks the weakest link in each triad for deletion  subsequently disposing of all marked links and with them of all three gene loops in the network 
aracnes complexity is o n     n   m     with n and m being the number of nodes and
patient samples  respectively  the n   cube term results from the dpi filter whereas the
n   m   term is due to the mi filter

machine learning algorithms

in order to embed the nodes in p space     topological parameters were chosen and computed
for each node i in the network  these parameters were selected as follows 
    degree
    average degree of neighbors
    clustering coefficient
    pagerank score
    hits hub score hits authority score
    farness centrality
    betweenness centrality
    average betweenness centrality of neighbors
       the i th component of the eigenvector associated with the  nd  smallest nonzero 
through the    th eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix
after computing each of the    values for each of the nodes in the aracne network 
they were normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one  so as to reduce clustering distortion due to scaling  as already stated  the unsupervised learning method for the
grouping of network nodes according to their topological properties in p space was k means
clustering  the supervised machine learning algorithms logistic regression and gda were
used for survival outcome prediction  softmax regression was used for cancer stage prediction  the optimization of parameters of the maximum log likelihood function for logistic
regression and softmax regression was performed with stochastic gradient ascent  the optimization of parameters for gda was carried out by finding their maximum likelihood values
analytically  the mi estimator function used for the mi feature selection filter was adapted
from a code repository 

 

results and findings

the network inference was completed for a subset of     patients using aracne  in workbench        an improved and faster version of the original aracne algorithm  the corresponding adjacency matrix was exported as an nnf file and loaded into snap after
appropriate conversion  the undirected network constructed by aracne had one giant
connected component consisting of       nodes and        edges with a minimal fraction
of closed triangles resulting from application of the data processing inequality  see below  
nodes not connected to the giant component were ignored 
the k means clustering algorithm discovered   prominent clusters in p space  with      
               and      nodes  each of these clusters was then subjected to mi correlation
ranking  for each cluster and for each node an mi estimate measured the correlation of the
gene feature values with the cancer survival and cancer subtype output values  thus ranking
each node within the cluster in descending order  for each cluster  the        and    nodes
with the highest mi value were used as features for machine learning  after training and
testing for each of these instances the following results for the success rates of output value

figure    machine learning success rates
prediction were obtained  see figure    
while none of the clusters appears to yield a significant improvement in success rates
over conventional mi feature selection  especially for gda  cluster   with     nodes seems
to be the most promising candidate for the search of predictive features genes as it raises the
success rates of both logistic and softmax regression  for future work  it may be more instructive to try an iterative procedure and create a subgraph of the cluster yielding the largest
improvement at each step  subsequently subjecting this subgraph to the same clustering routine and discovering subclusters which may yield a further improvement still  subdividing
clusters in this manner may be a method to identify predictive features and examine what
topological patterns they have in common
