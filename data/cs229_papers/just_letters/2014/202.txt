abstract
there has been a significant increase in earthquakes in central and eastern us  ceus  in recent years  this
increase in seismicity has been associated with human activities like wastewater injection  and is referred to as induced
seismicity  one of the components for hazard and risk calculation from induced seismicity is the level of ground shaking
expected from an earthquake at a site of interest  in ceus  because of historically low seismicity  there is limited
information to predict these shaking intensities  even with the recent increase in seismicity  the sparsity of seismic
networks limits the available information 
us geological survey  usgs  collects and maintains a did you feel it   dyfi  database where users report online
when they feel an earthquake  dyfi data is much more widely available than other ground motion data and is used
here to generate a ground motion intensity prediction model  additionally  we assess the hypothesis that intensities
generated from induced earthquakes tend to be different than those from natural earthquakes  a mixed effects regression
model is used as our primary prediction model since it allows estimation of random effects associated with earthquakes
and regions  we show results from various prediction functions used in our model and conclude that the intensity
predictions could not be differentiated for induced events 

 

introduction
there has been a dramatic increase in seismicity in ceus in recent years  ellsworth        there is a
possibility that this increased seismicity in ceus is caused by anthropogenic processes and is referred to
as induced or triggered seismicity  the earthquakes are a nuisance for people and some larger magnitude
earthquakes have also caused structural damage  hence  it is important to quantify seismic hazard and risk
from this increased seismicity 
one of the major components in determining seismic hazard and risk is the expected level of ground shaking
at a site  level of ground shaking from a given earthquake is typically estimated using previously collected
ground motion data in a region  however  in ceus due to historically low seismicity and sparse seismic
network  there is not enough ground motion data available to constrain the prediction models  in this study 
we use dyfi data which is more widely available to develop an intensity prediction model and to assess if
intensities from induced events differ from natural events 
since dyfi data is recorded on a continuous scale  regression models are best suited for prediction  assessing the difference in predictions from different earthquakes can be achieved by using a random effects model 
additionally  another random effect for regions can also be calculated to assess how intensities vary across
regions  thus  the intensity level can be predicted from a combination of fixed effects which are a function
of earthquake magnitude  depth and earthquake to site distance  and random effects which are computed for
each earthquake and each region  hence  a mixed effects model is utilized as the primary model to achieve the
objectives of this study 
the mixed effects regression model is also compared to a support vector regression  svr  model  this
is primarily done to assess the effectiveness of mixed effects regression compared to other popular regression
models  however  it should be noted that svr does not have the functionality to assess random effects 
hence the second component of this study to evaluate whether intensities differ for induced events could not
be achieved using the svr model 
 

the data   did you feel it 
usgs has been collecting dyfi data from users since year       when an earthquake happens  users can
visit the usgs website and answer a simple questionnaire regarding the extent to which they felt the earthquake  based on users responses  usgs then assigns an intensity level to each report called the community
decimal intensity  cdi   cdi is indicative of the modified mercalli intensity  mmi  which is assigned based
on the damage from ground shaking in a given region  more information about dyfi can be obtained from

fidyfi data was collected through personal communication with usgs for all earthquakes from year     
to            with a minimum magnitude of   and having a minimum of   dyfi responses  this data was
collected for earthquakes between latitudes    and      and longitudes     and      this data covered all
of central and eastern us  a total of         individual cdi data points were collected from     earthquakes
with this criteria  the data contained cdi values and user locations  it was combined with corresponding
earthquake information like magnitude and depth  and the earthquake to user distance was calculated 
   

data processing
the data collected as mentioned above was cleaned up and processed before using it for model fitting 
there was a flag in the data that marked some values as suspect  these suspect values were completely
removed  data points with a cdi of less than   were also removed since usgs does not calculate a finer cdi
between   and    finally  only those data points were retained that had an earthquake to user distance of at
most     km since that is our range of interest  the data after this initial cleanup is shown in fig   

fig     dyfi data collected from central and eastern us
after cleaning the dataset  data points from only those earthquakes were retained which had a minimum of
  recordings  on the next step  each users location was assigned to a region  marked by a grid of     latitudes
and longitudes  finally  data points from only those regions were retained which had recordings from at least
  unique earthquakes  after this processing  a dataset of         points was obtained which was subsequently
used for model training 
   

features
the primary features used for modeling were the earthquake magnitudes  earthquake depths and earthquaketo user distances  different models utilized different functions of these features  the details of feature implementation are described in the models section below  the other set of features used to model the random
effects in mixed effects regression models were the unique identifiers for each earthquake and each region 
 

training of regression models
using the dataset described in the previous section  various models were trained and compared  the
description and results from these models are shown below 
   

mixed effects regression model
a mixed effects regression model performs prediction by combining the contributions from fixed effects
and random effects  in this case  the fixed effects are defined as a function of earthquake magnitude  depth
and earthquake to user distance  the random effects are a property of each earthquake and each region  and
can include the intercept terms and the slope terms associated with fixed effects features  this model can be
represented by the equation below 
cdi   f  m  d  h          
in the above equation  the function of earthquake magnitude m  earthquake to user distance d and earthquake depth h corresponds to the fixed effects   corresponds to the random effect for earthquakes and is called
the event term  having a non zero event term implies that the event yields an intensity which is consistently
higher or lower than the mean prediction for all earthquakes  similarly   defines the site term and is estimated
for all regions where data was recorded   regions were described in the section on data processing    refers
to the residual for each data point

fiduring training of a mixed effects regression model  coefficients for both fixed effects and random effects
are determined  the random effects coefficients can be used to evaluate whether certain earthquakes or regions
are more likely to cause higher or lower intensities  the results from training mixed effects regression models
are shown below 
      training results
various models with different combinations of features and their functions were used during training 
results for some of these models are shown below

in the above models  models   to   are termed linear models since the fixed effects are linear functions 
models   and above are termed attenuation models since their functional form is more representative
of

ground motion attenuation  in the model equations  parameters da and ba are defined as d        and
max   
log da       respectively  as described by  atkinson et al         parameters de and be are defined as

d    h  and max    log de       respectively 
as observed from the table  model   for linear models and model    for attenuation models had the smallest
residual standard deviations  a    fold cross validation was performed for these two models to obtain another
comparison metric  cross validation errors rmse of       and       were obtained for model   and model    
respectively 
   

support vector regression
support vector regression  svr  model was used to compare mixed effects regression model with another
model  svr was implemented using the algorithms developed by  chang and lin         svr with l 
regularization was used with cost parameter c   a linear kernel  no kernel  were implemented since it provided
an equation form which could be easily implemented later  the svr algorithm can be described as shown

recommended in the algorithm implementation 
the parameter  was fixed at       parameter c for linear kernel was determined using grid search 
running the algorithm on the complete dataset took a very long time  hence during grid search a subset of
       data points was randomly selected for parameter selection  for linear kernel  the mean square error
was minimized at c        this parameter value was used to train the complete dataset

fi      training results
while training the complete dataset  the computation time was found to be very long  hence  at this stage
of the study  the training was done on a random subset of        data points  using  svr with the parameter
value described above  a residual standard deviation of        was calculated for linear kernel  this was about
the same standard deviation as obtained from mixed effects regression model without random effects  hence 
for this set of analyses  svr did not perform better than a mixed effects regression model 
 

results
observations and additional results obtained after training the models described in the previous section
are shown below  since svr did not perform better than the mixed effects regression model  no further results
were generated for svr 
for mixed effects regression models  it was observed that the difference in residual standard deviations
among various models was not very large  however  as a general trend  the standard deviations reduced with
inclusion of random effects  it was also observed that linear models had a higher standard deviation than a
comparable attenuation model 
despite the small differences in residual standard deviations  the importance of using attenuation models
is demonstrated in fig     the attenuation models  as expected  better model the physical process of intensity
attenuation with distance  the intensity reduces faster at smaller distances and then the decrease gets flatter 
since in hazard and risk assessment  we are usually interested in intensity behavior at short distance ranges 
the attenuation models are the better choice for mixed effects regression

to assess the second goal of this study about whether event terms differ for induced events  the event
terms from model    were plotted on a map  as shown in fig     from a visual analysis  the event terms in
regions where induced earthquakes have been observed did not appear to be different than for regions with
natural earthquakes  hence  at this point  we could not conclude that ground motion intensities generated
from induced events differed from those generated from natural earthquakes 
 

conclusions
in this study  various regression models were trained for predicting ground motion intensities from an
earthquake  intensity prediction is one of the major components in hazard and risk estimation  the models
were trained using dyfi data from ceus  another important component of this study was to assess whether
intensities from induced earthquakes differed from those from natural earthquakes  this was assessed through
evaluation of random effects associated with different earthquakes  since the regression model required both
fixed and random effects  a mixed effects model was used as the primary model for prediction  results from
mixed effects regression were also compared with svr  which did not include random effects  for the analyses
performed in this study  svr did not perform better than the mixed effects regression model 
it was observed that inclusion of random effects reduced the residual error in intensity prediction  it was
also observed that even though difference in residual errors were relatively small  a regression model should be
selected based on the physical attenuation model for intensity to enable better prediction at shorter distances

we also concluded that a significant difference in event terms could not be observed between induced and
natural earthquakes  hence  event terms could not be effectively used to distinguish induced from natural
events 
 

future work
the work done as part of this study was essential in understanding the effective utilization of large datasets
and the implications of using different models for prediction  however  the scope of work that can be done
with this dataset is very broad and there are numerous avenues for further exploration 
one of the first next steps for future assessment should be filling in the finer details in the models  svr
should be extended to the complete dataset to verify the residual standard deviations obtained from the subset
of        data points  results should be assessed further  for example  by validating the predictions from the
models in this study with those by  atkinson et al         the variation of predictions should be compared
with observed data at different magnitude and distance levels  it should also be assessed if predictions have
a bias due to different number of responses for each earthquake or region  there is also a possibility that
different prediction models are better suited for short and long distances 
after verifying the applicability of the models  the event terms and site terms could be further analyzed 
spatio temporal analysis could be used to determine auto correlations  the event and site terms could also
be linked to certain physical properties  for example  the faults causing the earthquakes or the soil conditions
at a given region 
finally  the prediction model can be used as an input for hazard and risk calculation  for the case of
induced seismicity  risk estimation at a certain site can be used as a decision support tool to inform decisions
on operations that might cause earthquakes  thus  the prediction models developed in this study could be
ultimately used in seismic risk mitigation
