introduction

from southern china  but belong to various dialect
groups  likely representing different ethnic groups 
india was at that time also a british colony  immigrants from india to singapore hailed mostly from
the southern part of the country  but with a significant minority  such as the sikhs  coming from the
north as well  it has also been found that many
singaporean indians have a higher fraction of european ancestry as compared to native indian populations  malays are the indigenous people of the
malay archipelago  the native malays of the singapore made up just a small proportion of the total malay population on the island  the majority of
whom migrated from malaya  now malaysia  and
the dutch east indies  now indonesia  

singapore is a small island nation situated at the
tip of the malay peninsular in southeast asia  it
existed as a british colony from      to       interspersed by a period of japanese occupation from
     to      during world war ii  throughout its
colonial history  singapore has been the recipient of
extensive immigration from various parts of asia 
and the same diversity is still reflected in singapores ethnic composition today 

characterizing the population substructure of singapore can not only help illuminate its cultural history  it also has potential medical implications for
singaporeans  for example  uncovering population
substructure could prevent spurious results in genetic association studies for disease  while many
studies have previously explored the question of substructure in a global context  few have done so on a
population that exists in such close geographic proximity  and therefore shares more genetic similarities

various classes   martin       
as can be seen from figure    three ethnic groups
constituted the majority of the migrant population
in british singapore  the chinese  the malays  and
the indians  today  the population of singapore
stands at      million  of which      million are residents  of the latter group  the racial breakdown
is as follows         chinese         malay  and

a legacy of the countrys history over the past two
centuries 

the singapore genome variation
project
with the advent of modern day genomic sequencing 
and the rapidly decreasing cost of the technology  it
has now become feasible to collect large amounts of
genetic data from populations that span different geographic areas of the world  for example  the     
genomes project is an international research effort
to establish the most detailed database of worldwide
human genetic variation  consisting of     individuals from   regions  the      genomes project consortium         the availability of such information
has not only contributed significantly to our under 

yet  it likely that there exists uncharacterized substructure within these three ethnic populations in
singapore  most singaporean chinese originated
 

fitween all possible haplotype pairs by calculating a
distance matrix  the metric we choose to consider is
the hamming distance  which is given by the number of loci at which the two haplotypes do not share
the same snp  normalized by the total number of
snps  mathematically  the hamming distance h
between haplotypes a and b is

standing of the genetic structure that underlie the
differences between human populations  but has also
aided in the search for genetic variants that may be
associated with certain diseases or traits 
in a similar vein to the      genomes project  the
singapore genome variation project  sgvp  aims
to provide a publicly available resource for cataloging genetic variation within the singaporean population  especially in the context of the three major ethnic groups  the data can obtained online
at http   www statgen nus edu sg  sgvp  after some initial cleaning up  sgvp contains data
for a total    chinese     malay  and    indian individuals at about     million single nucleotide polymorphisms  or snps  teo et al          snps  representing a single base  a  c  g  t  change at a
single locus  is the most common way of measuring
variation within a genome

where in this case m                for example 
the hamming distance between two haplotypes that
have the same snp at all loci is    whereas the hamming distance between two haplotypes that have different snps at all loci is   

unsupervised learning methods
with the hamming distance matrix calculated  we
can now proceed to apply some unsupervised learning techniques to further analyze the data  we first
use k medoids clustering  kaufman   rousseeuw 
      with k     to see if haplotypes belonging
to the three ethnic groups can be correctly clustered together  k medoids clustering is conceptually
similar to k means clustering  with the main difference being that in the former  each clusters center
must be chosen from the original set of data points 
whereas there is no such restriction in the latter 
here  we choose to use k medoids instead of k means
because the hamming distance is a non euclidean
distance measure  and the notion of a mean is less
clearly defined within such a context  we use the
kcca function found in the flexclust package in r
to perform the clustering  leisch        

in this project  we plan to first apply several unsupervised machine learning techniques on the snp
data to see if we can reveal any underlying population structure  using this information  we can
then also attempt to devise a prediction algorithm
that can classify an individual into the correct ethnic group based on his or her genetic data 

methods
data processing
the initial step of this project involves processing the data into a format that is suitable for further analysis  since humans are diploid organisms 
sgvp has data on snps found on both copies of
each individuals chromosomes  thus  we have a total of     chinese      malay  and     indian haplotypes  for each autosome  non sex chromosome  
we first identify and retain only the snps that can
be found in all three ethnic groups in order to ensure a common ground for comparison  the snps
are represented by  s and  s  where   denotes the
presence of a specific nucleotide base  and   denotes
the presence of an alternative base  here  all the
snps are biallelic  only two possible variants exist  

in addition  we also want to examine the data using classical multidimensional scaling  mds  on the
hamming distance matrix  classical mds  also
known as principal coordinates analysis  finds a distance matrix d  between a set of points in some
reduced dimensional space  that is as close as possible to the original distance matrix d in the full
dimensional space  the advantage of this method
over principal components analysis  pca  is that
it does not require a euclidean distance measure 
which the hamming distance is not  of interest is
the fact that classical mds yields the exact same results as pca when the distance matrix is euclidean

we then concatenate all    autosomes into a single long string consisting of a total           snps 
this is taken to be a single haplotype  following
this  we want to compare the pairwise distances be 

fik medoids classification with unseen data

 cox   cox         we use the cmdscale function
in r to implement classical mds 

to see how k medoids classification as described in
the previous section works with previously unseen
data  we randomly split the haplotypes into training
and test sets  overall      chinese      malay  and
    indian haplotypes are used for training  with
the remainder reserved for testing  each test haplotype is assigned to an ethnic group according to the
medoid it is closest to  the average results over   
trials is shown in table   

finally  we consider a third unsupervised learning
algorithm  hierarchical clustering  this is an agglomerative method that seeks to come up with a hierarchy of clusters of the haplotypes  the algorithm initializes with each haplotype in its own cluster  pairs of clusters most similar to each other  as
measured by the hamming distance  are then sequentially fused  until only a single cluster remains 
the distance between two clusters is taken to be
the maximum of the pairwise distances between the
haplotypes in each cluster  otherwise known as complete linkage  we use the hclust function in r to
perform the clustering  and the colordendrogram
method found in the sparcl package to plot the
dendrogram  witten   tibshirani

multidimensional scaling

using k medoids clustering with k      we found
that one chinese  malay  and indian haplotype were
each respectively selected as the medoids  for the
remainder of the haplotypes  we can define a classification based on the cluster they each belong to 
for example  if a haplotype is assigned to a cluster
with a chinese medoid  then it is classified as chinese  the confusion matrix arising from this process
is shown in table

as we can see from table    k medoids clustering
gives relatively good performance when attempting
to classify the three ethnic groups from this data set 
all     of the indian haplotypes are correctly classified  while the same is true for       and      
of the chinese and malay haplotypes respectively 
all misclassified malay haplotypes are classified as
chinese  and vice versa 

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

coordinate  

figure   the     haplotypes in  d space  each
individual point is labeled according its true ethnic
group  c   chinese  m   malay  i   indian   and
is colored based on the cluster it is assigned to by
the k medoids algorithm  as per table   
 

fifor this particular case  the choice of k      which
corresponds to taking the first split at the very top
of the dendrogram  results in the separation of the
indian haplotypes from the chinese and malay haplotypes  which is the expected outcome given the results from k medoids and mds  however  when we
take k      the second top most split occurs within
the indians  therefore  hierarchical clustering appears to give an inferior performance as compared
to the previous methods we have attempted 

we see from the mds plot that there is a good clustering of the three different ethnic groups in  d coordinate space  the first  and major  coordinate separates out the indians from the chinese and malays 
and the second coordinate further differentiates the
latter two groups from one another 
in addition  we can also observe  based on the how
the points are colored  where the haplotypes that
are placed into the incorrect cluster by k medoids
lie on the mds plot  the   malay haplotypes that
are misclassified as chinese are all on the left of
coordinate    placing them closer to the bulk of
the chinese haplotypes  similarly  the lone chinese
haplotype wrongly labeled as malay is proximate to
malay haplotypes  overall  the structure of the plot
suggests that the position of a haplotype in  d coordinate space is a strong predictor of the ethnic
group it belongs to 

nevertheless  the fact that the indian haplotypes
have subdivisions that occur close to the top of
the tree suggests potential presence of substructure within the singaporean indian population  to
further investigate this claim  we repeat k medoids
clustering with k     

k medoids clustering with k    
figure   shows a similar plot as figure    but with
the haplotypes now colored according to the clusters
generated by k medoids when k

the dendrogram arising from hierarchical clustering
is shown in figure    branches that fuse near the
bottom of the tree are more similar to each other
than branches that fuse closer to the top of the tree 
based on the tree topography  the appropriate value
of the number of clusters  k  can then be decided
upon a posteriori

exists some substructure within singaporean indi 

fisults show indian haplotypes as being more genetically distinct  furthermore  when k medoids is
performed with k      a split within the indian
haplotypes is observed  while we do not have the
geographic ancestry of the individuals in our data
set apart from their reported ethnic group  we hypothesize that this split could correspond to singaporean indians originating from either northern or
southern india  the large latitudinal distance of
the country could explain why hierarchical clustering revealed substructure in the indian haplotypes
that is not present within the chinese and malays 

ans  also  the exact position of an indian haplotype within the yellow cluster when k     is a relatively good predictor of whether it gets assigned to
the yellow or green cluster when k      indicating
consistency between the results from k medoids and
mds 

discussion and future work
in this project  we are interested in studying how genetic data can be used to identify chinese  malay 
and indian singaporeans  as well as finding out if
any additional population substructure exists beyond the ternary labels assigned  previous studies
have used pca on raw snp data to understand population substructure  patterson et  al         price
et  al        novembre et al         however  in
our case  we condense the information found within
the snp data into a hamming distance matrix  this
reduces the number of dimensions our methods have
to operate on  thereby improving runtimes 

if it were true that the observed substructure within
the indians is due to latitude  then our mds plot
could be revealing an eastwest split along coordinate   and a northsouth split along coordinate   
in future work  we could explore this question by
introducing individuals known to be from northern
and southern india  and observe if k medoids clustering produces the expected patterns 

we can see from the results of our mds plot that coordinate   is the principal axis of variation  and represents the separation of the indian haplotypes from
the chinese and malay  this is corroborated by the
correct classification of all indian individuals using
k medoids  the mds plot also shows a smaller separation between the chinese and malay haplotypes
along coordinate    accordingly  k medoids exhibits
a small number of misclassifications between these
two groups  these results suggest that the three ethnic groups are genetically distinct enough such that
a relatively straightforward method like k medoids
can achieve good classification performance  furthermore  even as k medoids clustering is an unsupervised learning method  once the medoids have
been established using the training set  the test
haplotypes can be assigned to a cluster based on
their hamming distances to the medoids  without
the need to repeat the entire algorithm
