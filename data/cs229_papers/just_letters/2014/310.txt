i ntroduction

the application for the hand described in this paper is
a new underwater robot intended for exploration and biological research in coral reef zones in the red sea which
will allow marine biologists to remain above water while
obtaining specimens  positioning equipment  and performing
other monitoring and maintenance tasks via tele operation
system down to     m below the surface  at pressures to
   bar     the hand is compliant  underactuated  and backdrivable and uses flexures instead of pin joints  subsequently
reducing mechanical complexity 

buoyancy makes object with density similar to sea water
subject to disturbance such as unsuccessful grasp or pinch
and could be floating around  re grasping or re pinching the
object could be very slow in tele operation tasks  for this
specific application  it would be helpful to sense the pinch
or grasp quality to prevent slip when exerting force  which
could typically be solved by using static force sensor  however 
most of static force sensors cannot be used under water due to
the change of water pressure  other problems include limited
space on the finger tip  difficulty of accurate force sensing over
different contact positions 
to solve this problem  we propose an active sensing method
to evaluate pinch quality based on non static force sensors that
have already been installed in the fingers for other sensing
purposes 
the idea is to vibrate the finger in certain frequency when
pinching the object to obtain information that might indicate
the pinch quality  similar active sensing idea has been done
in      where a vibration motor was used to resonate with
the finger so as to detect the contact position  however  it is
difficult to vibrate the finger fast enough without extra actuator
due to the slow mechanical response of the finger compliant
joint  to solve this problem  we propose a different active
sensing method  instead of fast vibration  slow squeezing
motion was used while sensing  the sensing information were
then converted into pinch quality indicator using machine
learning methods  the following sections talk about the details
of sensing  experiments  machine learning methods and the
optimization

underactuated hand can automatically adapt to the object
with easy control but still cannot solve all control problems 

data acquisition

the basic experiment setup includes an underactuated hand
developed for an underwater robot  an external motor driver  an
arduino due and a pc  the arduino due collects data from
the finger sensors via i c communication and does position
pid control of the motors that drive the fingers  a piece of c  
code runs on the pc which communicates with the arduino
due to give high level position commands to the hand and
acquire sensing data  on each finger there are   sensors with
  sensor channels  known as   axes of an accelerometer on
the fingertip and   joint angle sensor channels  detecting
the motion of each finger with    hz sampling rate  the
experiment setup is shown in fig     left  
in each pinch test  two opposed fingers were driven to
target positions to pinch an object  then started to move slightly

block  middle and right  two target objects used in the experiment  a piece
of pink foam which is stiff and a piece of black foam which is soft 

back and forth to squeeze the object for three and a half cycles 
after that  the object was slowly pulled out  and a mark   
series   digital scale was used to measure the pull out force 
this pull out force evaluates the pinch quality  i e  larger force
corresponds to stronger pinch  the pinch position for each
pinch test was randomized to achieve varied pinch quality 
two objects were used in the experiment  known as a piece
of stiff pink foam and a piece of soft black foam  which are
shown in fig     middle and right   for each object     sets
of sensor data were recorded

f eature e xtraction

joint angle sensor data were unfiltered because the noise is
not significant  a typical joint angle sensor reading throughout
the pinch test is shown in fig     because of the periodic
squeeze  features were extracted into means and standard
deviations of the upper and lower peaks of the periodic signals 
since accelerometer is sensitive to mechanical and electrical
noise  the data was low pass filtered at around   hz using
equi ripple window for extracting the upper and lower peak
during the squeezing cycles  a standard deviation of the noise
 the difference between filtered and unfiltered signal  was also
computed as the inhibition of noise might reveal information
about the pinch  a one axis accelerometer data in a typical
experiment of pinching a piece of pink foam is shown in fig 
   all the features are listed in tab  i

a  labeling optimization
the original label is the pull off force of each pinch test
which is continuous and need to be discretized  k means
was used to categorized the pull off force into multiple levels
 clusters   by sorting the cluster centroid  the labels become
indicators of the pinch quality  where larger label corresponds
to better pinch  the number of labels was optimized with
softmax logistic regression to acheive the minimum training
and test error 
b  learning algorithm
four different methods known as k means  logistic regression  softmax regression   svm  support vector machine  
and svr  support vector regression      were implemented
to classify the data sets  the explanations of above algorithms
are in      the gradient ascent method of softmax regression
algorithm with multiple labels is shown as follows

data were normalized so that each feature in the training
examples has a mean of   and a standard deviation of    the
test data were normalized in the same way that the training
examples do with the normalization parameter derived from
the training examples  all the above algorithms use both
normalized and un normalized data except logistic regression
 softmax regression  because of the difficulty of finding a
good initial condition to start without crashing the code  the
normalization algorithm is shown as follows

fithe mean and stanford deviation of training and test
errors and the avergae computation time were acquired for
each method by    runs of learning with randomly chosen
training and testing sets  based on whcih the performance of
the methods can be compared  svr was chosen for further
optimization due to its better prediction accuracy and computational efficiency 
c  feature selection
feature selection and evaluation based on svr method
was done to optimize the feature set  in feature selection 
the contribution of each feature was prioritized with backward
search  in each iteration  searching for the feature that makes
least effect on the test error when being removed and then
remove it for next iteration  test errors and training errors were
recorded during the iterations  to evaluate the contribution of
each feature quantitatively  the effect caused by each feature
was computed from the difference of test error of each feature
before and after being removed  which is regarded as the feature score  thus  for a feature that causes the test error increase
when being removed  its score is negative  since a single
score result has to be computed based on the same training
and testing data sets for prioritization consistency  which is
not statistically accurate     rounds of feature selection and
evaluation were done with randomly chosen training and test
set to get the feature scores

number of labels

d  prediction strategy
another reason for choosing svr is that it provides a
non binary result indicating the confidence of the prediction
which gives more information and more flexibility  since in
real application  tele operation task  one can always choose to
redo the pinch if the confidence of good pinch is low  so one
strategy is to ignore any prediction that is within a predefined
confidence margin which can further improve the performance

methods   n and un denote normalized and unormalized data

as weak features 

r esult

a  number of labels
as shown in fig    the training and test error of softmax
regression increases dramatically as the number of labels
increases  this is because for each label there is not enough
data points and the data is not very separable  therefore 
the number of labels is set to   for all the rest of learning
algorithms 
b  machine learning algorithms
the size of training data set and testing is     and     for
each method the training and testing data sets were generated
randomly for    times and computed correspondingly  the
result is shown in tab ii  svr outperformed the rest of the
algorithms due to its comparatively low training and test error 
efficient computation and non binary output 
c  feature scores
the score of each feature is given in fig    as shown in
the plot  feature      and   has zero or negative effect on the
performance which called as bad features  feature        and
    good features  are the three most important features foe

classification 

d  feature set and prediction margin
performance of svr was optimized by selecting different
feature sets and a prediction strategy with different margin 
the feature sets include all features  features without bad
features  features without bad and weak features  and only
good features  two different prediction margin      and     
was tested which resulted in      and       ignoring rates 
as shown in tab iii  the feature set without bad features
gives the best performance  the   good features can already
guarantee the accuracy to be around      with     prediction
margin  the accuracy can be up to

the learning curve  fig   was computed based on svr
algorithm with zero prediction margin  which runs    times

test errors acquired from    learning test using different
feature sets and prediction margin   t he amount of data that
was ignored given different prediction margin is also provided

pinched objects  according to the actual implementation  the
good features are upper peak and lower peak standard deviation
of proximal joint angle and lower peak mean of middle joint
angle  in the robotic hand  the proximal joints are quite flexible
and twisting of which sometimes can cause unstable pinch as
the two finger tips are not faced each other  this fact might
explain the reason that the proximal joint angle is such a good
indicator of the pinch quality  the bad features include upper
peak mean of two of the three axises of the accelerometer
reading and the distal joint angle  all these sensors are very
sensitive to noises  most of the weak features are peak mean
of the sensor readings  understanding the importance of each
feature for evaluating the pinch quality can help to choose
which sensor to implement if a more simplified hand is needed 
vii 

for each data size  the training error and test error tend to
converge at the data size of around      which indicates the
data that we collected is enough for the learning

of training and testing sets

d iscussion

all the supervised learning algorithms discussed in section iv demonstrated decent performance because the data
is intrinsically very separable according to the   labels  kmeans had poor performance because the clusters calculated
by this algorithm does not necessarily reflect the real labeling
and is very sensitive to data stretch  as a result  k means
method has very different learning results on normalized and
un normalized data 
as shown in the result  in terms of learning performance the
best choice of the number of labels is    which corresponds to a
classification of good pinch and bad pinch  higher number
of labels results in much higher learning errors  however  in
terms of real pinch application  it is desirable if the algorithm
predicts continuous pull out force  thus  the more the number
of labels is  the closer the prediction is to continuous case  svr
and softmax regression show better classification results than
svm when the ambiguous classification region with equal or
approximately equal probability is neglected  in real application  such neglect corresponds to abandoning the current pinch
and redoing a firmer pinch to guarantee the pinch quality 
as shown by the feature score and performance with
different feature sets  deleting the features that have negative
impact can slightly improve the performance  most of the
features related with standard deviation are more useful than
absolute values  since the latter tend to vary over different

c onclusion and f uture w ork

in conclusion  with the data and features acquired from
pinch experiments with an underactuated robotic hand  logistic
regression  softmax regression  and svr both demonstrate
a training error and test error less than      labeling optimization shows the best choice of the number of labels is
   yet the real application suggests larger number of labels 
feature selection shows there are   most influential features
that captures the major properties of the    features  which
lowers down the computation cost significantly  in the future 
more data sets will be acquired from experiment to lower
down the variance of the above learning algorithms  learning
algorithms to detect the properties of different objects will be
developed
