introduction
structural health monitoring is becoming a hot topic in the recent decades because it provides
engineers with information about the building damage and characterization strategy by analyzing
data obtained from the monitoring sensors installed on structures  in the past  people have been
focusing on detecting the building damage using dynamic properties such as frequencies and
mode shapes  and performing nonlinear structural analysis directly  however  these methods are
not sensitive to minor damage or local damage and they are extremely computationally
expensive and time consuming  in contrast  detection technologies that utilize statistical signal
information are more accurate and easier to implement  thus in this project  analyzing the
structural seismic behavior data using different machine learning algorithms was focused on so
as to predict the behavior of the structure in future extreme events 
methodology
the general statistical pattern recognition procedure used for building health monitoring can be
summarized in the following four steps  operational evaluation  data acquisition  feature
selection and statistical modeling for future discrimination  since structural damage affects the
dynamic properties of the structure  which will change the statistical characteristics of the
measured acceleration time histories  the training data used in this project were chosen to be the
acceleration time histories of the structure under different damage states  undamaged and
damaged   the data generation followed the paradigm mentioned above and the data was
obtained from simulating a four story  two bay by two bay steel frame quarter scale model
structure  total    sensors were located on   columns at each floor and each sensor measured
acceleration response in two translational directions during different loading events  several
damage sensitive features  dsfs  were then extracted from those time history records at
different locations under different damaged states subjected to different excitation sources  these
dsfs represent the dynamic behavior of the structure  which varies according to the damage
state of the structure  two damaged states of the structure were included in this study and they
were combined to be labelled as damaged as opposed to the undamaged case  the combined

fidamaged states were defined as removing all the braces from  st and  rd floors  resulting in a    
stiffness loss in y direction at each floor  as the excitation is in y direction   this means that only
the major damage was characterized as damaged state  ensuring the data associated with the
damage states being more separable  statistical models using different machine learning
algorithms were then developed to be used for future damage categorization  each algorithm was
trained and the probability of errors was evaluated on the validation set

data generation and feature selection
the data generation program  datagen  was obtained from the website of the iasc asce shm
task group  in the simulation  the excitations were modeled either as the independent filtered
gaussian white noise or the direct shake at the roof level  nonlinear structural time history
analysis was performed to get the acceleration time histories using nigam jennings integration
method with a damping ratio of    and a noise level of    this method decomposed the
structural system into its modal space  integrated each mode assuming the excitation was
piecewise linear over a time step  and superimposed to get the time history responses  the
acceleration data sets used in this project were then generated using different random seeds using
the datagen program in matlab  the typical acceleration time history data is shown below in
fig    in this project  the acceleration records generated last for    s with a time step of      s 
thus the acceleration data has         rows and    columns  which represent the    different
locations of the sensors 
yet  if the raw data were used directly as the input matrix  a high variance problem would rise as
a result of over fitting  also  acceleration time history itself could not directly represent the
damage related behavior of the structure  thus  to preprocess the data  several damage sensitive
features  dsfs  were extracted by fitting an optimal autoregressive  ar  model with an order of
  to each time history record  which was the smallest order that could be used to achieve a stable
behavior  ar coefficients obtained from this model could directly represent the natural
frequencies of the structure in various damage states  thus these coefficients could be combined
to compute the damage sensitive features  dsfs   which could most effectively represent the
seismic behavior of the structure

each acceleration time series was divided into     segments with each segment containing     
data  the data per segment was then normalized and an optimal ar model with an order of  
was fitted to the model and the corresponding coefficients were obtained using matlab built in
function arbug  dsfs were then computed as functions of ar coefficients  with the number of
dsfs and orders of coefficients determined by a forward search algorithm  three basic dsfs 
which are functions of the first three ar coefficients for each segment per acceleration time
history  were included in this model 
  



            

              

the logarithmic combinations of the first and second dsfs were also used as the other two
features  furthermore  the floor level and location of the sensors at each floor level  and the
shake sources  either independent filtered gaussian white noise or direct shake at the roof   were
also selected to be the other three features  different random seeds were used to generate
acceleration data at each location    times for one undamaged and two damaged states
respectively  and then the dsfs were computed accordingly  thus  the inputs have   features in
total  with total        data sets for training   m         n     to better use these data to train
the models       samples were randomly selected from these data sets several times and the
results were averaged  the response of the model was categorized using two labels  damaged or
undamaged  following the similar procedures  test sets with      testing examples in total were
obtained 
algorithm description
because this problem is a binary classification problem  several classification algorithms were
selected as potential candidates 
naive bayes was first tried for a quick start because it was easier and faster to implement
compared to other methods  a uniformly distributed prior was used for the damage states and
naive bayes algorithm was performed in matlab using the naive bayes class  the results

fiindicated fairly large training and testing errors of     and      respectively  yet the
performance of the algorithm could not be further improved efficiently by adding more features 
which implied there were issues with the model itself as we had a high bias problem  this was
because the prior distribution used in this model might not be appropriate  however  trying
multiple of other distributions for the prior could not significantly improve the results  indicating
more studies need to be done on the damage states definition so as to come up with more suitable
and case specific prior distribution for applying the bayesian algorithm 
as the dsfs are approximately normal distributed  the gaussian discriminant analysis was
then used and a multivariate normal distribution was fitted to each     sets of features per
acceleration and the mean and covariance matrix were computed for undamaged and damaged
states  the training and testing errors were     and      which were better than those from the
naive bayes model  also  by computing the kl divergence of the probability density functions
of the features with undamaged and damaged states  a threshold of the kl value was obtained 
the structure can be classified as damaged if this value has been exceeded  however  this
method requires a larger set of data then those data previously described to get an optimal
threshold  the data in this case needs to be grouped for each acceleration record   as a
consequence  the training and testing error obtained using this method were fairly large       
and       
logistic regression algorithm and support vector machine  svm  algorithms were then tried to
classify the damage state of the structure in the next step  matlab toolbox and liblinear     
package were used and surprisingly errors associated with svm were large      and     for
training and testing respectively   while logistic regression model gave a relatively smaller
training and testing error of     and      different kernels for svm were tried  and the
training and testing errors were successfully reduced after conducting the kernel and feature
selection  the gaussian kernel gave the best results   yet still logistic regression model
performed much better 
to further develop a better model  neural network algorithm with    hidden neurons and  
output layers was used to train a model  the neural network algorithm was implemented in
matlab using nprtool  and the network was trained to classify the inputs according to the labels
using scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation  in structural engineering practice  engineers
are more interested and concerned about minimizing the mislabeling error associated with the
case when damaged state is mislabeled as undamaged state  the confusion matrix indicated this
mislabeling error was as low as about    for both training and testing  other network layouts
were tired with different number of hidden neurons  some generated fairly small total errors  but
with higher error for damaged misclassified as undamaged  thus  even the total error was
relatively larger  the    hidden neurons layout was chosen to be the optimal model as the
interested error was the smallest

discussion and conclusion
lots of features were included at first  resulting in a high variance problem in the model  by
engaging only the appropriate damage sensitive features  the model seemed to have a high bias
problem  yet adding more features could not really resolve this issue because of the complex
property of dsfs  however  the best training and testing performance was achieved using  
features  which could generate relatively accurate results 
as in this problem  the prior of the damaged states were difficult to define  using only a uniform
distribution to estimate the prior was not accurate enough  thus errors in naive bayes model
using uniform priors were fairly large  as in real life  the damage situation is hard to describe
with the lack of the statistical data  more studies on describing the prior distribution of the
damage state are needed before more accurately using the bayesian algorithm 
the results indicate that the logistic regression model and the neural network model were
capable of generating the best performance  and thus are recommended for future prediction of
the health performance of the structure in extreme events  such as earthquakes 
future objectives
when including the data associated with a minor damage state  i e  just removing the braces from
one floor  it turned out that the data were barely separable and the training and testing errors
were both very high  thus one of the next steps in the future is to find out how to describe this
more complicated situation and engage more specific major and minor damage states  i e  revise
the labels to     damage states  features that are more sensitive to structural damages could be
discovered following structural experiment testing and more algorithms could be tried in the
future to come up with better machine learning models
