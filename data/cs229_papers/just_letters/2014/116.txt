introduction

human activity classification has wide reaching applications  such as in providing medical assistance to disabled
or elderly persons  this project implements several machine learning algorithms to classify human posture and
movements  the different activities being classified are 
sitting  sitting down  standing  standing up and walking
the difference between sitting and sitting down is that the former is the static posture  whereas the latter
is the transitional movement from standing to sitting 

past work
bodor et al  developed a novel method for employing image based rendering to extend the capability of the
human movement classification      sminchisescu et al  have developed algorithms for recognizing human
motion in monocular video sequences  based on discriminative conditional random fields  crfs  and maximum
entropy markov models  memms      
however  vision based systems have issues in camera installation  lighting  picture quality  privacy and
etc   which may render the system impractical in certain applications  as a branch of movement classification
techniques  wearable sensor based system could solve the above problems thanks to the development of nanomanufacturing technologies and ultralow power embedded systems  which makes the wearable sensors cheap 
small and compact  ugulino et al  collected human movement data from   adxl    accelerometers  utilized
c    tree  iterative dichotomiser    id   and adaboost to classify the human movements and have obtained
high recall and precision      this project utilizes the same set of data but a different set of models to compare
classification performance 

 

data

the data is made publicly available on ucis machine learning repository  it can be accessed at  http 
  groupware les inf puc rio br har dataset 
the dataset contains the following features
age  weight  body mass index  height
x y z axis readings from   different accelerometers

features
description

the features used in our models are the    accelerometer readings  although the original data also contains
age  weight  body mass index and height  they are neglected in this preliminary analysis and classification
because they are less relevant in determining human movement compared with the    accelerometer readings 

   

preprocessing

in the initial implementation without any preprocessing of the data  precision and recall were very low  to
improve performance  different ways to scale the data was investigated  more specifically  we tried z score
scaling and      scaling and tested the resulting effects on performance

randomizing the data since the raw data is presented as a series of sampled outputs from the accelerometers  it was important to randomize the order of the data sets  especially when we were performing smaller
tests where only a small constant number of training example were chosen  due to the physical nature of the
data  consecutive training examples are largely dependent  thus reducing the rank of the training matrix  it
was found that randomizing the order of the training sets improved precision and recall 

   

principal component analysis

since the feature data is of dimension     which makes it impossible to directly visualize the data  principal
component analysis  pca  is used to reduce the dimension for the feature dataset from    to    three principal
eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors are used  the data is represented in figure    the horizontal data
distribution corresponds to human lateral movements  moving forward  backward  left  right  while the vertical
data distribution corresponds to human longitudinal movements  standing up  sitting down  

 
   

gaussian discriminant analysis
binary classification

gda models the input features as a multivariate normal distribution  with the class label as a bernouilli
variable  for each class  the classs data is used as positive training examples  while data from each of the other
classes are concatenated to be used as negative training examples  after constructing the training set  model
parameters are calculated with the following formulas

multi class classification

for a testing example  in order to make a prediction into   of the   classes  the posterior distribution is calculated
for each class  and the predicted label is chosen depending on the largest posterior 
that is
h  x    arg maxy p x y p y   where y

the learning curve shows significant improvement in performance only up to the first      training examples 
thus svm is efficient in terms of training set size 

 

support vector machine

a support vector machine builds a model that seeks to maximize the margin between the separating hyperplane
and data points  more specifically  the model parameters are found by solving the following optimization

to implement svm  we used libsvm

k means

since a particular human movement usually requires a harmonious coordination among different parts of the
body  accelerometer readings would exhibit clustering properties  therefore  k means has been attempted to
classify the human postures and movements 

learning curve
the k means learning curve is shown in figure    k means has a poor overall classification performance and
the learning curve for the k means does not exhibit a typical decreasing pattern as most of the supervised
learning algorithms do  one reason is that k means is not a supervised learning method and the clustering
algorithm does not necessarily correspond to how human accelerations of a movement are coordinated and
clustered  therefore  k means could only roughly classify non movements from the accelerometer readings
while detailed movements classifications need to be done by using supervised learning methods like gda and
svm  therefore  it is concluded that unsupervised learning algorithms like k means may not be suitable in a
supervised learning context 

 

results

for the final results  training was done on taking     of the data from each class and testing was done on the
remaining     of the data  the following table shows the precision and recall for each model

future work

the algorithms exhibited have shown high precision and recall  the next step would be to integrate the
algorithm into a portable embedded system that has limited computation capability  memory space and or
battery life to classify the movements to make the system practical  with the development of the cloud
technology  the wearable devices could also just collect the accelerometer data and send it wirelessly to a data
processing server to carry out the processing and classification work  this would enable the devices to work
longer and more reliably given the limited resources available
