weappliedldaand qdabasedondomainassumptions on thedataset specificallythatthe
data set was assumed to be a mixture of two multivariate gaussian distribution  since wireless link
metrics are generally considered as gaussian random processes  after noticing lower f  scores we
wanted toexploreothermodelsforbetterprediction weappliedlogisticsregressiontoseeifthereis
linear separability between the two classes  we also tried naive bayes as it is one of the simpler
classifier to get a baseline  the f   scores were still in the     range  this prompted usto explore
nonparametric classifier   specifically kneighbors which works well in nonseparable spaces with
multiple clusters  for kneighbors  we weighted the points by the inverseoftheirdistancefromthe
boundaries

to evaluate the performance of each model we used foldcross validation whereeach fold

noticethat asthe trainingsize increases the f scores foreach modelstarttoconverge itcan
be seen that kneighbors was best performing    precisionwith    f scorein predicting link 
failure  this gives the  intuition that there are clusters of points for link failure within good link
conditions

even though kneighbors gives good results  it requires access to entire training data set to
make the predictions  this may not be a preferred approach in a smartphone for realistic
implementation dueto spaceand memory constraints hence  generativemodelswill be more desired
