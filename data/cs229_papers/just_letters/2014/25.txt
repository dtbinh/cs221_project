background

spatial and physicochemical information about a
site on a  d structure to create a     feature vector that can be easily used for training a model 
previous work has shown that use of this set of
features is be effective for predicting fragments
that bind areas of a given protein     however 
it has not been used to predict where a particular fragment binds on a protein  given that we
know there is an interaction  a knowledge base
has been previously constructed of feature
vectors at locations in all of protein fragment interfaces in the pdb  each of which is annotated
by the fragments that bind     this database contains physicochemical information about     million local fragment binding environments from
       protein ligand complexes  using this as
our dataset  we employ machine learning methods to train a model to classify whether a given a
protein microenvironment binds a specific fragment 

understanding the local structure surrounding
the site of a protein drug interaction can provide important insights into the mechanism of
the drug and can help inform drug design and
repurposing     while structural information exists for a subset of protein ligand interactions 
it does not cover the space of all experimentally known interactions  as a result  the sites
on proteins to which drugs or ligands bind are
not always known  to address this problem 
our eventual goal is to use existing structures
of protein ligand interactions to train machinelearning classifiers to predict locations of ligand
binding  because the chemical search space for
ligands is large  we will approach this problem
from a fragment perspective  fragments are low
molecular weight compounds          da  that
are parts of a given ligand  the same fragment
may be present in a variety of ligands  so examining this problem from a fragment perspective
is highly useful because it reduces the number
of molecules to evaluate and allows data from
multiple different ligands but the same fragment
to be combined       in order to predict the locations of fragment binding  we will focus on the
sub problem of 

 
   

methods
data

data from the existing knowledge base from
fragfeature   were used in this work  because there is a high degree of redundancy in
existing structural data  the knowledge base was
filtered to contain structures with less than    
sequence similarity  the sequence similarity
cutoff of     was chosen because it is generally
considered to be the cutoff between homologous
and non homologous structures  we chose to
use such a stringent cutoff because we want to
be able to predict whether a fragment will bind
a given site on a protein even if the protein
is not similar to known proteins  the best
resolution chain from each blastclust    
sequence similarity cluster was selected  the
subset of feature vectors in the knowledge
base generated from this set of dissimilar protein
chains was then used as our data set  these data
were then divided into positive and negative
examples for each of seven fragments  positive

given a location on given protein and a particular fragment  will the fragment bind to the
protein at that site 
to tackle this problem  we use structures from
the protein data bank  pdb   a repository
for structural information  close to        
experimentally determined  d protein structures are readily available in the pdb     many
of these structures are ligand bound  providing
abundant examples of local protein environments
 microenvironments  that are involved binding
ligand fragments  in order to capture information about these microenvironments  we employ
feature     a computational tool developed by
russ altmans group  this method integrates

seven fragments  whose structures and id

for k nearest neighbors and bernoulli naive as representative fragments for the creation of
bayes classifiers as well as svm models  data was algorithms to predict binding because of their

of classification and regression algorithms were

built with ten trees  bernoulli naive bayes was will bind that fragment  however this initial
implemented with laplace smoothing  learning performance was poor  because environments

feature vector was centered around  we
reduced dimensionality feature vectors were then trained a model for each fragment using

used to generate principal components captur  most frequently found next to  this separation

that the various models are likely making the

although the optimal kernel varied depending
on the fragment being considered  interestingly  in order to diagnose and assess the performance
applying svm when viewing the problem as a of our classifier  we examined the training and
classification resulted in far lower performance  test error on increasing portions of our data
this suggests that it is most informative to view set  we focused on the errors associated with
ligand binding on a spectrum rather than as a our best performing classifier  support vector

relative performance of models for adenine reflects a trend similar to that of other fragments  given this diagnosis that our model is overfitting

set  decreasing the parameter  which loosens
the contraint on the fitting parameters  made
performance worse  as expected  but increasing the parameter did not have an effect on
error rates  this indicates that the original
conditions  with a regularization parameter of
   already produced a relatively sparse model 
additionally  we tried reducing the dimensionality of our feature space using two different
methods previously shown to be effective in
improving feature models  neither the use
of principal components nor reduced feature
sets decreased the large gap between training
and test error  this suggests that the original
model may already be implicitly decreasing
the dimensionality by putting small weights on
certain features  further supporting the theory
that the original model is sparse 

we also analyzed the features given the highest
weight in the svc linear classifier model 
the top    positive and negative coefficients
for the features are shown in figure    this
analysis showed that the most important
positive predictor of adenine binding was the
presence of a ring system in the  th shell 
and the most important negative predictor was
the presence of a hydroxyl group in the  th shell 

 

conclusions

overall  no model showed consistent performance across residue centers and across
fragments  suggesting that we need to take
into account more information about context in
order to produce a good classifier  in general 
ligands  as well as fragments  associate with
a binding pocket in a protein  in which many
interactions across many residues help them to
bind  a single feature vector may be too
limiting in what spatial features and orientation
information it can represent  in the future  we
will expand our classifier by scoring multiple microenvironments surrounding a binding pocket
to get an aggregate score to predict binding 

further evaluation of our best model  svr with
a gaussian kernel  showed that performance
varied widely over different residue types  as
shown in figure    this indicates that specific
amino acids are important in the binding of
each ligand  for example  using microenvironments centered around cysteine  glutamate  and
aspartate residues were best for the prediction
of adenine binding  this could be a result
of hydrogen bonding or other electrostatic
interactions that serve as the center of the
fragment protein interaction  however  more
 

fimajor constraint on the performance of our classifiers  as evidenced by the constant downward
trend in test error shown in figure    despite
our efforts to reduce overfitting with pca and
trying different regularization parameters  it appears that our models still have high variance 
we had insufficient data for many residues  preventing us from training a model for those microenvironment types  as a result  we hope to
obtain an expanded dataset with a reduced sequence similarity cut off and try training models
on this  we are also confident that as the pdb
grows at a rate of almost        new structures
each year     we will be able to incorporate more
data and vastly improve our models

using regression algorithms  which we have
shown to be more effective than classification
algorithms  we can generate binding scores that
can be easily aggregated across a cluster of
neighboring microenvironments which may form
a pocket  this will allow us to expand towards
the ultimate goal of predicting the binding site
of a ligand on a protein  given an experimentally
