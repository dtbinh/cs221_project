introduction

there has been increased scrutiny in understanding the anthropogenic sources for methane emissions due to methanes
potency as a greenhouse gas      there are two approaches for studying of methane emissions  emissions inventories
 or bottom up studies   and remote measurements of methane fluxes  or top down studies   emissions inventories
calculate the leakage rates for fugitive methane over a given area as 
e 

m x
n
x
j

ai j  efi

   

i

where e is the emissions rate  ai j is the activity  or the number of pieces of equipment of type i  at well pad j 
efi is the emissions factor for equipment type i  n is the set of possible equipment types  and m is the set of wells
in the location of interest  the inner sum provides the emissions rate for a specific well pad 
one of the significant problems with the bottom up emissions inventory approach is that of scale  even when very
detailed measurements of the equipment and stages of operations are conducted  doing so comes at the price at
looking at a small and not necessarily representative sample of the wells and operators  this is the most significant
critique of allen et al  which found lower leakage numbers when compared to other emissions inventories      in order
to better rectify the discrepancies between the top down and bottom up studies  two simultaneous development
need to occur  there needs to be more proper accounting for the number of devices and pieces of equipment present
on a particular site and there needs to be better sampling and estimation of emissions factors at the device level 
the intention of this project  which is to apply machine learning techniques on high resolution spatial imagery to
identify well pads  is meant to serve as an initial step in this process 
while there is uncertainty in estimating both the activity counts and the emissions factors  there are also significant
disagreements in simply estimating the number of well pads in a given location  for example the si to brandt et
al  report a  x difference in the number of reported well completions in the united states between two different
data sources  for      the epa reported      wells  while ihs reported             the purpose of this project is to
identify well pads using high resolution spatial imagery  which is a first step towards estimating activity counts over
an entire production field 
machine learning classifiers are widely utilized for remote sensing based classifications  and their application has been
of particular interest in the literature of classification of high resolution spatial imagery  common classifiers utilized
in the literature include nave bayes  k nearest neighbor  neural network  random forests  and svm  mountrakis
et al   in a review of the use of svm for remote sensing applications  describe the ability for this classifier to better
balance the bias variance tradeoff as well as it ability to use small training sets  they also demonstrate that svms
are disproportionally used in applications with high resolution imagery     

 
   

methods and data
data and preprocessing

the region of study for this project is the fast developing bakken oil field in western north dakota  this area is
of particular interest as oil production has increased from      bbl day in      to              bbl day in      
specifically  the study area utilized was a      km  area of  m  pixel aerial photographs acquired in august     

fifrom the national aerial imagery program at the usda  a map of the study area within the context of the bakken
can be found in figure

for most remote sensing applications  analysis and classification is performed at the pixel level  however  this has
been found to be not particularly effective for high resolution imagery due to the the heterogeneity of adjacent pixels
     the widely accepted technique for extracting data out of high resolution imagery has been to aggregate pixels
into image objects  or segments       in order to isolate these image objects  the ecognition software platform was
utilized using the multi resolution segmentation function with the following parameters which were utilized to best
identify well pads  scale  which roughly corresponds to size         shape  or the influence of color on segment       
and compactness  which corresponds to the ability of segments to have varying size         the result of this process
divided the image into      segments  which serve as the input rows for the classifier  this set was later trimmed
down to      segments to avoid edge effects around the perimeter of the region of interest  a visual example of the
result of segmentation can be found in figure    each of the segments has     features  or columns  derived from
three overarching categories  spectral reflectance  rgb and near ir  and brightness  segment geometry  shape and
size   and texture  which is based on the grey level co occurance matrix from haralick et al       
a matrix representation with the segments as the rows and the features as the columns is used as the input data
for the classifier  the output is a binary indicator for whether the test segment is or is not a well pad  the well
pads were verified with gis layers of known oil and gas facilities in north dakota      and further refined by hand 
a schematic of the model function can be found in figure   

   

models

to perform the classification we used the following models and techniques which are commonly used in the literature 
utilizing default matlab functions 
   support vector machine  gaussian kernel

results

well pads are geographically scarce throughout the bakken oil field  and since size and shape are important segmentation characteristics utilized in our application of ecognition  are also scarce amongst the generated segments  of
the      segments used  post processing   only     are well pads          consequently  a classification could have
a     success rate while successfully identifying every well pad in the area  and still have falsely identified almost as
many wells as actually exist  in the context of using this classification to estimate fugitive emissions  this degree of
error is well above an acceptable limit  figure   demonstrates the scarcity of well pads in the data set  highlighting
the importance of highly accurate classification

to better analyze classifications results  such as shown in figure    we define both a true positive and false positive

a receiver operating characteristic  roc  curve is examined in order to explore the trade off between tpr and f pr
in different algorithms  to generate the curve      of the available data is used as the training set  and     is used
as the testing set  each algorithm is applied ten times to  the same set of  random permutations of the data  and
the roc curves are shown in figure

the data set required is small enough that the time required for classification  even for the entire bakken oil field  is
not prohibitively expensive  however  the computation time required to generate the features is  the data set used in
the limited area surveyed in this work took roughly    hours to generate  in order to determine the order in which to
include features  a principle component analysis  pca  is performed first  examining the principle components  the
first    of which are shown in figure   a   it is clear that each component is heavily dominated be a small subset of
features  an arbitrary  and conservative  threshold of     is set  and  in order  the features with coefficients whose
absolute value exceeds the threshold are selected  this roughly ordered set of features is then used to explore the
effect of reducing the feature space  by classifying the same random permutations of the data set used above with
the best performing algorithm  the random forest  with an increasing number of features  the resulting true and
false positive rates are shown in figure   b  

 

discussion and conclusions

the results of this work demonstrate the viability of utilizing machine learning classification for well pad identification
in the bakken  as demonstrated in figure    the overall accuracy of well pad identification is highly dependent on the
acceptable rate of false positives  though both the neural network and the random forest performed well overall 
the random forest benefits the most with a give allowance of false positive error  the roc curve shows a change
in the relative increased true positive rate as a function of false positive rate at an approximate     false positive
rate  indicating that this point results in the best model performance for the intended application

 b  demonstration of the affect of data reduction on true positive
and false positive rates 

additionally  the result of the pca allows for a dramatic reduction of the feature set  and consequently a significant
reduction in computation effort  figure   b  demonstrates that after the inclusion of     featuers  the accuracy of
the classifiers do not improve considerably  we estimate that this could lead to a reduction in computation time of
       
in the process of this analysis  we added      km  of area to an initial area of      km    this additional data
was meant to provide an analysis on the effect of classification accuracy as the training set became larger  however
only a modest increase in classification accuracy was observed  the lack of improvement likely resulted from using
the same segmentation parameters between data sets  which introduced some segmentation errors upon examining
the segments  however  the computation time required for segmentation was prohibitive to experimenting widely on
the effect of segmentation parameter selection  with the analysis of feature space reduction performed in this work 
further analysis in this area can be performed  additionally  the strict accuracy constraints for the calculation  low
acceptable false positive rate  likely contributed to the modest gains in accuracy 
future work will utilize the classification results of this work to isolate imagery in the immediate vicinity of the well
pads in order to perform a second segmentation step in order to identify surface equipment such as tanks  pumpjacks 
and compressors  this might test the limit of the spatial resolution of these images and as such higher resolution
imagery sources will also be explored
