predicting low voltage events on rural
micro grids in tanzania
samuel steyer  shea hughes  natasha whitney

abstractour team initially set out to predict when and where
low voltage events and subsequent outages would occur on microgrids in rural tanzania  our first hypothesis was that weather
parameters would drive most of the system variations  to test
this hypothesis  we compiled a feature space composed of grid
statistics and weather data for a year  and began implementing
machine learning algorithms including logistic regression  support vector machines  svm   principle component analysis  and
random forests to make our predictions  we were able to predict
outages with a      generalization error twelve hours into the
future using random forests  and our original hypothesis was
proven false  our model suggests that the presence of an outage
in the future is not directly correlated with any one feature  it
is due to the highly stochastic state of the system at any given
time 

i  i ntroduction
ver     billion people do not have access to electricity
around the world today  and the international energy
agency estimates that global energy demand will grow    
by       developing countries will account for     of this
increase  yet only     of the demand is likely to be met by
grid electricity     
the remaining     of electricity demand will be met
by some combination of off grid  micro grid  or stand alone
systems  in recent years the reliable and scalable operation
of micro grids  small scale power grids that can operate
independently  has arguably been the fastest changing  most
dynamic aspect of the global energy system 
our partner in tanzania  devergy  informed our group that
one of the biggest challenges to maintaining a rural microgrid is managing brown outs and black outs  these systems
are often very remote and difficult to reach  and providing
proper system management and maintenance requires careful
planning  through trial and error  devergy discovered that
quality of service drives micro grid success  with poor service 
customers grow impatient and usage drops 
devergy monitors power generation and consumption using
smart meters to see when voltage drops slowly over the course
of several hours  to prevent outages  devergy can either limit
total household consumption  or install new solar photovoltaic
 pv  generation towers close to customers using the most
energy 
for our project  we construct a model to predict outages on
rural micro grids that serve agricultural communities so that
grid operators  descos  such devergy can anticipate outages
and maintain customer trust

through discussions with devergy and supplementary research  we learned that weather patterns and seasonal changes
typically drive the majority of load variability and probability
of grid failures  we therefore begin by exploring how best
to apply learning algorithms to predict low voltage events
and corresponding system outages based on a set of weather
parameters and other features described in more detail below 
ii  data p rocessing
devergy provided us with microgrid data for two villages in
rural tanzania  doma and mlandizi  the micro grids for each
village are laid out as a series of interconnected nodes  each
node is either a    watt solar pv tower referred to as an enbox
 represented by a sqaure   or a smart meter  represented by a
circle   see fig     the grid grows in an organic manner as
new homes become connected and new supply comes online
over time 

fig    

schematic of part of mlandizi microgrid

the data provided by devergy included current  voltage in 
voltage out  and nodal mode readings for all meters and
enboxes  approximately     per grid  at irregularly spaced
intervals over a year 
we used the voltage in readings at the meters to spot low
voltage events on the grid  the meters are configured to run
household appliances at    v but have some built in flexibility 
according to devergy  performance of the devices attached to
the meters begins to suffer at voltage levels less than    v

fi 

and the coincident occurence of low voltage readings across
multiple meters leads to a grid wide outage 
for the purposes of this project  we define an outage
as     of the meters having voltage less than    v at any
minute over the course of the year  we set a threshold of
    because a single meter or even multiple meters droping
below   v hardly signifies a system wide event  but as that
percentage rises the stability of the grid becomes increasingly
compromised  under these constraints our dataset shows an
outage     of the time  or approximately       hours out of
the year 
we added weather data from forecast io which we found
using the geospatial coordinates in devergys dataset and
focused on cloud cover  which affects solar panel output  and
temperature  which influences electrical loads through cooling
demands  as our primary weather features 
we used devergys data to construct our grid features 
to convert the data into features appropriate for machine
learning algorithms  we first split it into separate columns
for each trait and meter enbox combination on the grid  ie 
voltage in for meter       we dropped all of the data other
than 

logistic regression works by calculating the sigmoid function of a linear combination of the features  tuned with the
parameter  
h  x   

 
   et x

the algorithm classifies as example xi as giving a   if
h  x        during the training phase  we choose  to
maximize the likelihood of the training data 
we then decided to run logistic regression again and include
weather forecasting at the time of prediction to see if this
would better inform our outage predictions 
b  support vector machine  svm 
svms are a type of supervised learning model  and in our
case specifically a non probabilistic binary linear classifier  an
svm functions by mapping examples from different categories
and dividing them by a decision boundary separating points
by as large of a margin as possible  mathematically  this can
be formulated

the cardinality of our feature space  including a month of
year feature to account for seasonality  was      we interpolated the meter and weather data at one minute increments  as
the minute level data provides the most granularity about the
state of the system  however  when applying machine learning
models  we often resampled the data at an hourly level for
computational speed 
iii  m odel s election   m ethodology
by nature  predicting either outage or no outage is a
binary classification problem  we therefore focused our analysis on three classification methods  support vector machines 
logistic regression  and random forest classification

by adding an arbitrary scaling constant and using a monotonic transformation on the objective function  we can reformulate the problem as

we can solve this optimization using its lagrangian  more
detail in the notes  to find the best possible decision boundary
for our data 
in our model we decided to begin testing an svm classifier
with a linear kernel  after training and testing on different
datasets for mlandizi  we viewed our results in confusion
matrices to asses the accuracy of our predictions 
c  random forest classification

a  logistic regression
after preparing our featurespace  we chose to begin our
analysis by running a logistic regression  logistic regression
was chosen as a starting point for our analysis for several
reasons  first  we are attempting to predict the outcome of a
binary categorical dependent variable  class labels  based on
our set of     predictor variables  features   therefore  we
had no reason to believe that our results would not be affine 
second  logistic regression is very interpretable and it is easy
to attribute variance to specific features  given our hypothesis 
we presumed that logistic regression would explicitly show
the proportion of the variance in our model that was due to
weather features 

due to discouraging results from support vector machines
and limited success with logistic regression for several hourahead forecasts  we decided to explore using a random forest
classification to improve and extend the forecast accuracy 
random forest classification and regression trees  carts  are
unique among machine learning algorithms because they can
handle non parametric  non linear  discrete categorical  and
continuous data as predictors  random forests leverage thousands of classification trees at once to improve performance 
an additional advantage to random forests classifications is
that they provide a measure of feature variable importance  an
estimate for how important the variable is by looking at how
the prediction error changes as the variables changes and all
other variables are held fixed 

fi 

random forests classification is an ensemble method 
where the model is selected as the best among a set  size
 param ntree   of randomly generated decision trees  each
decision tree is generated on the basis of a different subset
of the training data as a randomized  recursive partitioning
of the feature set  at each node  the tree algorithm decides
which variable among a randomly selected set of variables
 size  param mtry   to split as well as the value of that split 
the algorithm decides when to stop at a leaf  as opposed
to split again  and which classification to assign to terminal
nodes  constant class assigned to each leaf   the out of bag
dataset  remaining data  is used to estimate the classification
error of the model and variable importance of the features 
each vector in the test dataset is classified according to all the
decision trees  and the class assignment with the most votes
is the classification prediction for the input 
for this application  we used the default values for mtry
 square root of the number of features      and ntrees    
decision trees   we explored varying the size of the subset
of variables from   to    but were not able to improve the
forecast accuracy beyond the statistical variation in the results
 prediction accuracy varies about    from run to run because
of dual randomness inherent in decision tree generation   the
number of trees required to bound prediction accuracy and
variable importance for a cart model is related to the number
of predictors  and we varied ntrees from    to     and found
there were significant improvements through     trees and
then they levelled out  from a prediction accuracy low of    
with    trees to a high of     with     trees  
as the class frequencies are unbalanced in this classification
problem       outages      no outages  we explored the
effect of overriding the majority rule for random forest classification of oob examples with class priors  this modification
enabled us to slightly reduce our false negative prediction error
but resulted in a non compensated increase in false positive
prediction erorr  from    to approxmately    for a   hr ahead
prediction   we elected to proceed with using modified class
weights 
iv  r esults
to evaluate our models we used k fold cross validation
with k       meaning that we trained on     of the model and
tested on      calculated the out of sample error for outage
and no outage predictions  and returned the average of each
of those errors across partitions of the data  the   hr ahead
prediction accuracy for outage and no outage on the grid
for each of our models are tabulated in table i 
both logistic regression and random forests predicted outages with a less than     error for several hours into the
future  see fig    
the accuracy of logistic regression in predicting outages
 which is more significant for our partners than predicting
non outages  was fairly reasonable up until the about   hours
ahead  when error began climbing past     and remained
noisy up until twelve hours into the future  because outages
are so costly  it is worth the avoided cost for the micro grid
operators to send personnel to check on the state of the system
even if the outage prediction is only     certain 

fig     outage prediction accuracy for logistic regression and random
forest classification up to    hours in advance 

however  whereas the logistic regressions outage prediction
devolves into near random noise   to   hours in the future 
random forest classification appears capable of predicting
outages up to    hours in the future with a generalization
error of around      this result is a significant improvement
over logistic regression  and is far enough in advance to permit
devergy to anticipate and adequately address the low voltage
event by either sending personnel to install new generation
capacity or limit overall customer power consumption 
it is worth noting how poorly support vector machines
performed on our test data in general  first  the number of
support vectors often exceeded     of the training examples 
seccond  svms were unable to capture any of the meaning
of our data  the results were so poor we have chosen no to
include them in the graph  svm predicted a non outage in
nearly every case  so its prediction error was at or close to
     for outages  and    for non outages  we think this
reflects the facts that our data is not seperable  so a decision
boundary is not appropriate  its highly probable that a large
number of features  rather than a few support vectors  drive
the variance together

v  a nalysis
our investigations demonstrated that it was intractable to
predict grid outages on the basis of weather alone  temperature and cloud cover  without additional parameters such
as the state of charge of the batteries  results from svm
on the weather only feature space were not encouraging  the
occurence of outages seems nearly independent of temperature
and cloud cover  see fig     as a result  we modified our

fi 

strategy and leveraged all features related to the state of the
system  current  voltage in  voltage out  and mode  to train
our model 

fig    

fig     poor svm results on the basis of temperature and cloud cover only 

using k folds cross validation to train our model on the
full set of     features  the prediction accuracy for outages of
our logistic regression and random forest models approached
    for the   hour time window  the accuracy of the logistic
regression and random forest model precipitously decline at
the   to   hour window  though on different scales   we
hypothesize that   to   hours may be the order of a first degree
lag on the system  i e  that there are strongly interpretable
signals of a near term low voltage event in the state of the
system up to   hours in advance  and that there may be a
similar jump in the prediction error some additional number
of hours into the future 
based on the results of our random forest classification 
we ranked our features according to variable importance and
found that the top    features all account for a roughly similar
proportion of the variance  see fig      so it appears important
that we used a large feature set  also the most important
features are mixed according to type  including current  green  
voltage in  pink   and voltage out  light blue  readings of both
batteries and meters at distributed locations throughout the
microgrid 
this conclusion is buoyed by results from principle component analysis  the variance of the first principal component
is      the second      and the remaining components less
than     the first and second principal components consist
of a nearly even distribution of hundreds of features  the first
component consisting of more modes     out of the top    are
modes  and the second component consisting of more voltage
readings     of the top      both of these results suggest that
our feature set is fairly resistance to dimensionality reduction
and hence our problem is a good application for machine
learning 
to control for the possibility that svm was ineffective
because outages were sparse  we attempted l  regularization 

ranking of most significant features by variable importance 

penalizing a missed outage prediction several orders of magnitude more than a missed non outage prediction  and training
the model on a subset of data where outages were much more
prevalent  all of these methods either had no effect or resulted
in a model that predicted nearly      outages out of sample
 as opposed to the ground truth of no more than       as
an example of the svms bias towards a particular class  see
fig    which plots the false positive and false negative error
for training sets with a range of outage percentages 

fig     svm models exhbit extreme bias towards predominantly outage
or non outage predictions 

based on these explorations  and the even distribution of
variable importance among features  we suspect that svms
poor performance compared to the other methods is due to
the fact that the variance in our data cannot be explained
by a small number of features  we believe this accurately
reflects the complex dynamics of the micro grids  through
our discussions with devergy  we learned that it is difficult for
a human to reliably interpret the implications of a particular
meters measurements in isolation  as an example  a large
difference between a nodes voltage in and voltage out reading
may imply any of  the individual houses load changing 

fi 

a box being shut off  a transmission line hiccup  or most
critically the start of a low voltage event  these voltage
readings are based on a complicated combination of factors
that include whether the node is a meter or enbox  which
mode the meter is in  and what the potential differences of
the nearby nodes are  without a tractable system of humanintelligble rules to translate meter readings into interpretable
events  machine learning applications such as random forest
classification that leverage the full richness of the feature set
were most successful 
vi  c onclusion
our analysis has revealed several general lessons about
applying machine learning methods to predict micro grid behavior  first  we were able to predict outages quite accurately
several hours into the future  which we think reflects persistence in meter voltages  but had trouble predicting outages
beyond that time frame  we believe this is because our data
doesnt include the features required to longer term prediction
such as levels of battery storage and usage data for consumer
appliances 
second  no particular feature or small subset accounts for a
sizeable portion of the variance in the data  rather in order to
predict with accuracy out of sample we had to leverage models
that incorporate interactions between different features  for
this reason  random forest classifications far out performed
the non ensemble models  svm  logistic regression  
finally  based on our discussion with devergy and further
research  we expected to be able to predict low voltage events
at least partly on the basis of weather parameters  however 
we had little success with this method  for all prediction
windows  including    to    hours  temperature and cloud
cover did not rank among the    most important features  we
believe temperature and cloud cover were minimally predictive
because the types of electrical appliances in microgrids  lighting  phone charging  tvs and radios  are unlike those in a
conventional grid  air conditioning  central heating   whereas
heating and cooling loads are clearly related to temperature 
the implications of an unusually hot day on the demand for
phone charging is not as clear  additionally  while cloud cover
does certainly reduce the power into the solar panel  the power
that the battery provides to the grid is a combination of several
factors that we did not include  most important of which is
its state of charge  while several days of uninterrupted cloud
cover may influence the likelihood of a low voltage event 
the cloud cover in a particular minute appears to have little
bearing on the system stability 
next steps include to improve on our feature selection by
including autoregressive terms  battery charge levels at supply
nodes  and a seasonal parameter  system outages appear to
be clustered in the summer   additionally  we would like
to run a more systematic feature selection based on further
pca analysis and our results from the random forests feature
ranking
