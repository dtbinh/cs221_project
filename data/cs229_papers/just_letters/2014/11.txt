introduction

currently  there are around        children in
the california foster care system  foster care system is a government run system in which a minor
is placed into an institution  group home  or a private home  the reason a child enters the foster
care system may vary  including abuse and neglect
by or the death of the parents  the median stay in
california
the child can exit from foster care in different
ways  and this project focuses on   main ones  reunification with the primary family  adoption by
another family  aging out of foster care  and running away  this project aims to predict the exit
outcome based on the childs health state  reasons
for being removed from the childs immediate family  and the length of stay in foster care 
this project is only a predictive exercise  and i
cannot claim any causalities  for instance  i found
that the number of days spent in foster care is important in predicting the exit outcome of a child 
however  i cannot claim that staying longer in foster care causes a child to exit one way or another 
there can be other unaccounted variables that impact both the length of stay and the exit outcome 
such as the childs personality  the fact that the
number of days is predictive of outcome exit is not
surprising when we consider that the outcomes include adoption and emancipation  length of stay is
correlated with age  and the age of a child is highly
predictive whether the child ages out of the foster
care system or gets adopted

studies in social services have long been interested in how the placement experience and personal characteristics of a child affect the childs
well being  the main difficulties with the studies
are fully capturing the factors that can affect the result  including both the myriad of observable and
unobservable variables  hence  researchers cannot
easily recover the causal impact of foster care on
the child  for instance  simply comparing the outcomes of children of children who spent time in
foster care with those that did not leads to biased
estimate  the difference in outcome can be partially or fully explained by the pre placement experience  such as the extent of the abuse that the child
suffered prior to entering  one method to address
this issue is to have more extensive data on both the
childs placement and pre placement situations  as
done in  berger  johnson  bruch  james    rubin 
       the most convincing studies are  doyle 
      and  doyle         which uses the random
assignment of social workers to different cases as
instrumental variables  they find that putting children whose cases are on the margin into foster care
result in worse child outcome  in terms of health
condition and criminal activities 
with the recent passage of fostering connection act of       which increased the benefit to
the state child welfare services that the federal
government fund  there are longitudanol studies
looking at the outcomes of children out of foster
care   courtney  charles    nathanael j  okpych 
      has collected extensive surveys of the children aged from               during the year of
      and found that the children in the sample had
better experience than the national baseline  the

data
the data comes from adoption and foster care
analysis and reporting system  afcars   this
dataset is a case level dataset on an annual basis  which means each observation pertains to one
child for a given fiscal reporting year 
i restricted the years from              and focused on the los angeles county  i wanted to abstract away from cross county differences  which
include child welfare policies  income level  population composition  and others  i chose the county
of la because the foster care population of la
county makes up over     of the foster care population in california  during this period in la 
there were      exits from foster care  some observations had missing variables  i discarded all
the observations that had at least one missing variable  which yielded      observations 
labels
i focused my attention on   main ways in which
a child can exit from the foster care system  reunificiation with the family  adoption  emancipation
and runaways  emancipation means that the child
has reached the age of    and can no longer stay
in the foster care system  the breakdown of the
exit outcomes is summarized in table    as we can
see  the sample is very unbalanced  majority of the
children exit by reunifying with their parents  and
about a fourth is adopted  i will address this issue
of unbalanced classes in the estimation section

this table breaks down the different forms a child
exited from la county foster care system between
            

features  and feature selection 
the afcars dataset contains identifiable information of the child  the variables for each
observation may include the childs ethnicity  set
of disabilities  reasons for removal from original
caretakers  and age  there are multiple features
for disabilities and reasons for removal  and each
is a binary variable with   indicating that such disability or removal reason is applicable and   otherwise  the variables are not mutually exclusive 
which means multiple disabilities or reasons for removal can be applied to a single child  variables
for disability include mental retardation  visual impairment  and physical disability  reasons for removal may include neglect  physical abuse  sexual
abuse  parental drug abuse  parental alcohol abuse 
etc  in total  there are   variables that describe the
mental  emotional  and physical state of the child
when entering foster care  and    variables for the
reasons of removal 
to reduce the number of features  i performed
pca on the   variables for the health state and   
variables for the reason for removal  i tried to reduce the features to various number of dimensions 
but such processing did not yield much improvement in prediction 
i also reduce the number of features by adding
up the binary values of certain features into a larger
integer value  a child can have more than one of
the   variables that describe the health of the child
can equal one  i e the child suffers from both mental retardation and visual impairment  similarly 
the reason a child was removed from home may
include  neglect and physical abuse  the sum of
these binary values may summarize the severity of
a childs disability or the severity for the reason
for removal  for instance  we might suspect that
the situation of a child who was removed for neglect  physical abuse  and drug abuse by the parent
is more severe than a child who was removed only
for neglect  however  this feature reduction did
not improve the prediction performance either  in
fact  the performance worsened  this result indicate that the different reasons for removal and dif

estimation
i use all the features without reducing them to
a lower dimension  i randomly break the     
dataset into      training set and      test set 
to address the issue of unbalanced classes  i
weigh the penalty of incorrectly classifying a class
by the proportion in the training set  i implement
using the svm library in python  using the option
 class weight  
since i used sciki kit learns svm library  the
mathematical formulation is as follows 

the parametrization of the kernels are the following 
gaussian         polynomial  d     and r     

from the three option made a huge difference in the
performance of the predictions 
i then the confusion matrix to see which categories are most often confused  the results are
present in table    the columns represent the actual labels and the rows represent the predicted labels

  where ci corresponds to the penalty assigned to
the ith example based on the class weight and n
is the number of examples  the python package
of support vector classification  svc  implement
an one versus one algorithm  the algorithm constructs           classification coefficients  each
for the possible pairing of the   labels  when making prediction  an example is predicted using every one of the   classification  and the class that
receives the most vote is predicted 
i tried   different types of kernels  gaussian  linear  and polynomial  the kernels are parametrized
as follows 
gaussian  
linear  

k x  y    exp  x  y   
k x  y     x  y   

   
   

polynomial  

k x  y       x  y    r d  

   

below is a table that summarizes the accuracy of
the training and testing set accuracy for the different kernels  it does not seem that the kernel choice

as seen from the table above  the prediction
for reunification is over represented  even though
the actual proportion of reunification is       that
class is predicted     of the time  this fact may
be driven by how unbalanced the training set is 
even with the different weights for the different
classes 
i then examine the incremental impact on the
testing set accuracy by removing each of the features  the result is summarized below  i only included features that had made at least       difference 
as shown by the table  the number of days spent
in foster care seems important in determining the
exit outcome of the child  for this project  i choose
to use class weights rather than discarding examples to balance the training set  because i would
have had to discard too much of the data that i had 
in the future  i will try to develop an algorithm that
randomly selects a subset of examples  emancipation    reunification   and  adoption

discussion
one major concern i have of the estimation is
the fact that the training set was very unbalanced 
another weakness with the data set is that many
of the variables are binary rather than continuous
variables  for instance  i simply observe whether a
child suffers from mental retardation or visual impairment  however  i do not observe the extent of
each of the condition  hence  we do not know how
comparable one variable is to another  lastly  the

fact that the length of stay was most important in
predicting the exit outcome may not be very informative  it is correlated with the age of the child 
which is correlated with whether a child ages out
or gets adopted
