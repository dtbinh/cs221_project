introduction
suspended sediments in oceans  seas  and estuaries shape coastal geography  provide important
nutrients to ecosystems  and transport and bury harmful contaminants  although the problem has
significant interest in the scientific and environmental engineering communities  many of the the
mechanisms involved are poorly understood because of the difficulty and expense of measuring what
turns out to be a very complex system  the complexity arises from the fact that many estuaries
are dynamic regions  where the currents that move sediment depend on rainfall  wind  waves  tides 
salinity gradients  and anthropogenic manipulation  dams  weirs  etc    on top of this the physics
of how sediment particles interact with the sea bed and one another is still poorly understood 
especially at the scales of interest to biologists and coastal engineers  because of these challenges
the development of tools to study the problem is an active area of research 
the traditional tools of studying sediment transport are in situ field measurements and numerical models  and these each face challenges  because of the small scale of in situ sampling methods 
it is often difficult  and very expensive  to collect data over a large enough area to develop a strong
regional understanding of what is happening  numerical models have thus gained popularity as a
way to predict suspended sediment concentrations  ssc   erosion  and deposition  but these contend with their own problems of unknown boundary conditions and poorly understood transport
physics for silts and clays  to help fill the gap left in these two technologies  there has been work
to develop remote sensing algorithms using available nasa and european space agency  esa 
satellite imagery to map turbidity  an optical measure of the cloudiness of water  which serves as a
proxy for ssc  this is still a young technology and has substantial room for development 
san francisco bay is an excellent example of a system that showcases many of importances of
sediments and the challenges with understanding them  for one  it is a well studied estuary with
ample of measurements about the flow and sediment conditions publicly available 
this projects goal is to establish a relationship between available remote sensing data and in
situ measurements of turbidity in san francisco bay  this requires correlating the data at the
particular pixel of the measurement  and perhaps its neighbors  with the measurement itself  this
has been studied in other estuaries     and there are products available that can calculate turbidity 
but these are not calibrated for our area of interest 

data collection
there are two primary sources of data for this project  remote sensing satellite data and in situ
point measurements  satellite images from the meris probe taken in the time period of     
to      were downloaded from the coastcolour project      a data offering from the esa that
specializes in processing coastal images  each image pixel contains information of the intensity of
discretized reflectance of both visual and infrared wavelengths  as well as precomputed estimates
of turbidity  suspended matter  pigment  and chlorophyll  because the turbidity is of significant

interest  a spatially averaged turbidity is calculated in an attempt to create a turbidity feature with
reduced noise 
in situ measurements of turbidity are taken from three united states geological survey  usgs 
monitoring stations at alcatraz island  the dumbarton bridge  and the richmond san rafael
bridge each taken at a depth of   to   meters below the surface  these measurements are taken
every    minutes 
preprocessing the data includes extracting useful information for both datasets at matching
times and locations  this includes removing cloudy images as well as finding the image pixel that
contains the usgs sampling station  in all there are at most three samples for each image  one
for each valid image pixel and station measurement combination  for a total of     samples of   
features each 

regression methods
linear regression with l  and l  shrinkage parameters as well as support vector regression were
tested  the examined parameters are  number of principal components  degree of polynomial
expansions of the feature space  and svr kernels  many tests were run on the dataset to find
the optimal values of these numbers  for each test a parameter sweep for the optimal penalty
logarithmic parameter was done using k fold cross validation with   folds 
in order to ensure that the turbidity levels are non negative  all regressions are completed using
the log of the turbidity values  the performance metrics are given using the actual turbidity units
the computations use the python library scikit learn library      the limiting factors for
testing polynomial expansions and number of principal components were both the run time of
the parameter sweeps and the trend towards overfitting with high polynomial degrees and many
features  therefore  polynomial regression with high degrees was limited to using relatively few
principal components 

results
the linear regressions perform better than support vector regression  table     the high order polynomials are generally optimal with very large shrinkage parameters  which implies that high order
polynomials overfit the data  below are mean rme associated with the optimal penalty parameter
for some of the tested pca and polynomial combinations tested via   folds cross validation  figures
          as a point of comparison the coastcolour turbidity measure has a root mean square
error  rme  of        although this work shows substantial improvement coastcolour sediment
estimate  the r squared fit is only      
pca does not appear to be an effective tool for eliminating overfitting of the data as the full
set of data performed best  also  polynomial expansion of the features did not improved rme 
the regressions are sensitive to the shrinkage parameter and the search finds a smooth minimum
for the linear regressions  figure    but svr is more erratic  figure     these regressions tend to
under predict the large measured turbidities  figure

discussion
we are able to make a significant improvement over the out of the box measure of turbidity for
san francisco bay  however  the optimal test set r squared value of      suggests that there is
much work to be done in predicting the turbidity  the reason for the poor performance likely
occurs for a variety of reasons  most apparent is the disparity of scale in the data we use  because
the satellite data has a spatial resolution of about     meters  it will inevitably not be able to pick
up the small scale feature that may affect the in situ measurements  secondly  there is a three
dimensionality to turbidity and the satellite reads the surfaces  while the in situ measurements are
sampled at a depth of     meters depending on the tide  there may also be non linearities between
the satellite data and the actual turbidity that our regression models do not pick up  future work
includes not only expanding this dataset to more features and testing the value of neural networks 
but also a proposal to conduct our own experiment of taking aerial photographs of the bay  while
measuring the turbidity levels of south san francisco bay using boat transects to get a wider
spatial baseline of measurements
