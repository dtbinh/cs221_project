the many dimensions of net neutrality
 and how we reduced them 
erin antono  deger turan  justine zhang
present in the comments which did not originate from
form letter campaigns  hence we made an effort to
remove these duplicates 

introduction
in the spirit of democracy  government organizations
often solicit public comments before a major ruling 
ostensibly to incorporate the publics input into their
final decision  the massive scale of comments these
campaigns attract often prohibits manual inspection 
the ability to analyze and understand this large body
of comments computationally therefore allows these
organizations to better understand the publics ideas
and overall sentiment 
in this paper  we use unsupervised learning techniques
to understand the content of the comments that the
federal communications commission  fcc  has received  relating to its upcoming decisions on net neutrality  in particular  we discuss the application of
singular value decomposition  svd  to extract key
topical and linguistic characteristics of comments  we
first use svd to extract common topics and their representative comments and keywords  based on a tf idf
weighting of each word used  we then use svd on
a smaller set of linguistic features  and discover five
types of comments corresponding to the five top components extracted by svd  which appear to reflect
characteristics such as a commenters personal investment in the issue and the other figures and organizations present in the comments narrative  finally  we
perform a cross comparison of the topical and linguistic components 

preprocessing
we used a corpus of the original form letter documents
from the sunlight foundation    and the nltk sentence
tokenizer    to clean our data  we hence detected form
letter content within each comment on a per sentence
basis  in order to retain original content which a user
had added to a form letter  finally  the sentences were
normalized by removing punctuation and casing 
after early attempts at topic modeling  we found that
our topic keywords were dominated by names and addresses  additionally  the most salient keywords of several topics all clearly originated from specific sentences
in the comments which occurred frequently  and were
missed by our intial form letter detection  to account
for this problem  sentences containing irrelevant information such as names  addresses  or greetings were removed altogether  we further cleaned the data set by
treating sentences that occurred more than    times
as sentences from undetected form letters 
after this filtering  our results were still similarly impacted by the presence of short comments which were
not necessarily from form letters  but were still nearlyidentical to one another as a consequence of their
length  while it may be interesting to study the propagation of such buzzwords as net neutrality and
level playing field in short comments  we decided to
focus our analysis on comments for which the writer
could have plausibly contributed a meaningful amount
of personal input  as opposed to terse comments which
were basically variants of these buzzwords  as a simple heuristic  we removed all comments with less than
four sentences  after these steps  our filtered dataset
consisted of around        comments  among them
there are    form letter comments 

data set
as of september       the fcc has received over    
million comments on the subject of net neutrality  and
has made the full set of comments available to the
public  before the start of our project  the sunlight
foundation had done analysis on the comments  and
made a set of cleaned data available to the public  for
our project  we started with the sunlight foundations
set of         comments  which had been stripped of
a large number of garbage comments      to make the
task more manageable  we constrained our analysis to
a random subset of about        comments 
as was expected for a forum with open public submissions  the net neutrality comments contained large
quantities of form letters submitted from a variety of
sources  the sunlight foundation estimates that approximately     of the data consisted of form letters 
this redundancy made analysis more difficult  because
the large number of nearly identical comments obscured much of the vocabulary and linguistic features

method
we used the singular value decomposition algorithm
 svd  from scikit learn     to perform dimensionality reduction on our dataset  allowing us to discover
the most salient characteristics of the comments  as
a brief overview of the process  given m comments
and n features  let x  rmn be a matrix with xi j
  the value of feature j in comment i  given some
k   n  we produce a low rank approximation of x 

 

fixk   uk k vkt where k is a diagonal matrix containing xs k largest singular values  this hence represents
k components inferred from the original features  ui j
then corresponds to the value of new component j at
comment i  while vi j corresponds to the weighting of
feature j at old feature i  higher values roughly correspond to that component being more characteristic
of the comment or feature 

use its title ii authority to protect it 

topic     small business equality
most important words  fast lane lanes small business
businesses slow big open internet pay playing field afford level rules innovation create equal traffic
example comment  there is no difference between the
statements fast lane and slow lane  and fast lane and
hyper fast lane  were not stupid  this will only allow
big corporations with money to squeeze out little start up
companies that would have no way to afford to pay for this
hyper fast lane   

topic analysis

the full list of topics we labelled after analyzing the
examples are as follows  free and open internet  america government and freedom  cable companies  legal
terminology  innovation and startup encouragement 
isp profits  small business equality  isp consumer relationship  isp data treatment  companies controlling
information 

to determine the most common topics represented
in the comments  we used the term frequency inverse
document frequency  tf idf  scores of each word in a
particular comment as the set of features for that comment 
we applied the svd algorithm to this set of features  which is also known as latent semantic analysis
 lsa  when used in this context 

form letter topics
results

given the high volume of form letters  one question we
may ask is this  do form letters talk about different
topics than original comments  which are unaffiliated
with any form letter campaigns  to answer this question  we use the topic weights for each comment as
produced above  consider the average p
topic weight of
 
a set of comments s for topic j   s 
xs uxj   for
each topic  we calculate the average weight over all
the comments  over only the    form letter comments 
and over a random sample of    comments  as a control   a bar graph of topic weights per topic is shown
in figure   
from the graph we can see that in particular  form
letters seem to mention topic    legal terminology 
a lot more than the average comment  representative
words and comments for this topic are listed above  
this is corroborated by a manual examination of the
form letter comments  which are mostly fairly explicit
references to past legislation and proposed legislative
changes 

we chose the number of topics for interpretability of
results  arriving at k      topics  we also attempted
to choose k such that the improvement in reconstruction error  x  uk k vkt   levelled off  producing   
topics  but the differences between topics were much
more subtle  
using the notation above  after performing svd  for
each topic j  the most important words i maximize vij
and the most representative comments maximize uij  
for instance  here are the most representative words 
and most representative comment for a selection of
two topics 
topic     cable companies
most important words  companies cable comcast
speeds pay consumers charge speed competition netflix monopolies monopoly company money dont net
big warner faster lane
example comment  regarding the proposal to permit
cable companies and other isps to charge companies to provide faster downloads  this is the most ridiculous proposal
i have heard in a long time  the cable companies  eg  comcast and time warner are claiming that such fees to companies like netflix would not create a two tier fast lane slow
lane internet

you the authority to declare the internet a public utility
 from the daily kos     
the fcc should use its title ii authority to protect  net
neutrality   from battle for the net     

given these results  we may tentatively conclude the
following  while most comments encompass a wider
range of ideas  form letters are specifically organized
calls for legislative change

in addition to determining the topic content of the
comments  we also wanted to gain insight into how

we used features were based on linguistic characteristics of the comments  attitudes of the writers  and
entities the comments were directed to  we considered the following features from each document 
  sentences with  st singular related pronouns
  sentences with  st plural related pronouns
  sentences with  nd singular related pronoun
average   words per sentence
  sentences
  sentences with negation  no  nt  not 
  sentences with must etc

works and for a time this was acceptable  unfortunately

have reached a crossroads that could make or break the continued prosperity and innovation the internet provides

results

using these features  with k      we found the following of comments which were characterized in surprisingly striking and intuitive ways  which we list below 
the full table of components to features is shown in
figure

components corresponding to small eigenvalues had a

very helpful in discerning commenter attitudes 

i was a computer wizard practically before i could read

overall results
with these two different sets of characteristic components of our comment set  we wanted to investigate the
relationship between the two  to do this  we created
a matrix m  rtxc   t is the number of topics  c is the
number of components  ut is the u vector resulting
from topic modeling and uc is the u vector resulting
from comment clustering 
p

   legal references   defining features  low reading
ease  low profanity  lengthy comments 
forbearance furthers the objective of interpreting law in
light of modern technology and markets without undermining its core purposes 

from m   we obtain an other vector m     which is normalized such that m     m max m    a large m    i  j 

 

ficomponent  this may be the case because the legal
references bucket had the length and rigor of the comment as a strong characteristic  and personal worries
captured a lot of comments that were well informed
and used terminology  but were short or included colloquialisms 
we found significant correlation between the legal
reference comments  and the dreams and values comments in terms of subjects they tackled  even though
their level of rigor is was distinctive  large companies
controlling information was repeatedly mentioned in
personal worries  even though it is rarely mentioned
by legal reference documents  comments with high
profanity were also simplest  government and american values were rarely referred to in personal worries
or experiences  but were very common on comments at
tom wheeler  legal references and dreams and values 
most of the garbage data that was unusually long 
literary or complicated  such as the full text of the
great gatsby or lcd screen instructions  were also
contained in the legal references cluster 

value indicates high overlap between topic i and component j  a heatmap of these weightings is shown
in figure    we found that each component vector
pairing  which we call comment buckets  matched a
characteristic portrait of a commenter 
the correspondence of the topics and components
was reasonable  the most crowded comments buckets
were 
    personal worries   innovation and startup encouragement  most people in this bucket either are 
or particularly concerned about small business and
startup owners  i am a small businessman  the internet is critical my success  consigning me to a slow lane of
the internet might do serious damage to the success of my
business  also as a private individual i believe the internet
serves as a public good

    frustrated at tom wheeler   equality for small
business  the second most crowded bucket contains
most of the comments with swearwords  if you dumb
asses pass this law taxes will have to go up to pay for schools
and because some schools wont be able to afford it so the
education levels of schools will decrease    and facebook will
die out and many stocks will drop and die affecting the
stock market for many stockholders  with that all aside you
will piss off millions for literally no reason

future work
there are several directions in which we could expand
our work from this paper  looking further into our
data set  we should be able to extract more information on how modifications to form letters correspond
to the topics and comment characteristics that we have
found  in our current dataset  which contains a fraction of the original comments  there were not enough
form letters with original content added on to draw
any conclusions 
we could also investigate the mapping additional features such as gender and location of the commenter or
time of comment to the topics and characterizations
weve identified  triggers of high numbers of similar
comment submissions can be deduced  which can be
both in forms of celebrity or website encouragement 
or response to events  it would be interesting to further study the application of similar analysis on a different body of comments  especially on subjects with
multiple aspects and viewpoints  since the data was
    supporting net neutrality  the conclusions did not
lead to a meaningful potential classification problem 
the topic component cross analysis can especially be
helpful in debates with non binary outcomes 

    frustrated at tom wheeler   government  america  freedom  this bucket was much less profane  and
used patriotic references and national values extensively  mr wheeler and fcc members i grow increasingly
concerned with your attempts to ram an anticonsumer net
neutrality bill through the process  we know what you are
doing  you may feel inclined to bow to the corporate influences

    legal references   isps data treatment  containing relatively higher levels of rigor  this bucket shows
that people who are worried about monopolization of
data had the most eloquent comments 
isps need
to be reclassified as title ii common carriers allowing this
proceeding to go through would allow isps to charge people
extra fees to carry traffic from any online business that they
want if a company depends heavily or entirely on internet
traffic the isp could refuse to allow web pages to load in
under a minute

    experiences and anecdotes   innovation and
startup encouragement  this bucket held an interestingly high number of comments from people who
were very worried about their profits or lifestyles  but
did not have a very clear understanding of the case 
i am an artist  how can i succeed in an internet that favors already built giants  who will be able to find me in a
segregated cyberspace  i will no longer be able to find endless inspiration and utilize the internet the way i do now

conclusion
this research project is a first attempt at understanding the large and diverse data set that results from an
open comment platform  by clustering similar attitudes  subjects and concerns  common threads can be
found throughout the comments  using this type of

one bucket that we were surprised was the low correlation of use of legal terminology and legal references

 

fianalysis  the voice of public sentiment can be better
understood and taken into consideration for the issue

of net neutrality  and other debates in the future
