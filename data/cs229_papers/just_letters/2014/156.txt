abstract  the field of ophthalmology  the study
of the eye  has increasingly turned to medical imaging
to play an important role in diagnosing diseases  widespread medical conditions can be identified with only
pictures of the eye using computer automated processes  determining the segmentation of the circulatory system in the eye is difficult for doctors as the task
of distinguishing blood vessels by simply observing
retinal images has proven to be challenging without the
aid of technology  several morphological features of
retinal veins and arteries  like diameter  length  branching angle  and tortuosity  have diagnostic relevance and
can be used to monitor the progression of diseases     
this paper details the process and results of an attempt
to improve upon the accuracy of retinal image segmentation to aid doctors in diagnosing diseases of the eye
using supervised  support vector machine  and unsupervised  modified k nearest neighbor  machine learning algorithms 
introduction  many common medical conditions associated with the eye can be efficiently diagnosed by doctors through the observation of retinal images  this process has the potential to improve through
the application of machine learning techniques  altered
images that highlight the blood vessel patterns increase
doctors ability to correctly diagnose various medical
conditions such as diabetes  hypertension  and arteriosclerosis      furthermore  it may be possible to entirely automate the detection of eye diseases  one way
to alter retinal scans to distinguish the blood vessels
from the rest of the image is to establish a classification
problem in which each pixel is labeled as representing
a blood vessel  positive  or representing any other part
of the eye image  negative  
various features are available for an algorithm of this
type  rgb values of each pixel  pixel location  overall
curvature  shading  contrast  and many more  existing
machine learning methods approach this problem
through the use of support vector machines  svms 

with feature vectors comprised of some function of the
rgb values of pre processed image pixels among
other variables  currently  the industry standard is approximately     accuracy of each positive image
pixel     compared to hand drawn blood vessels carefully constructed by experts  this paper documents the
construction and application of an svm that nearly
matches this industry standard generalization error using publicly available data  in addition  an unsupervised k nearest neighbor  k nn  algorithm is developed to streamline the production of segmented images
with the ultimate goal being complete automation of
the eye disease diagnosis process 
data  retinal images publicly available through
clemson university     were used to train and test machine learning algorithms to detect blood vessels  a variety of different blood vessel patterns  image lighting 
and eye size were represented by these images  the
lack of consistency displayed by these retinal scans reveals the difficulty in distinguishing blood vessels and
non blood vessels  figure   below shows a fairly typical example of a retinal scanthe blood vessels are
slightly darker than the rest of the image 
figure    unprocessed retinal scan

in addition  this data set generously provided images
hand drawn by expert ophthalmologists  these images
contain the experts estimation of blood vessel location  training labels were generated for each image using its corresponding expert drawn image  for the purposes of this study  the expert labels were considered

fito be the ground truth locations of blood vessels in the
given retinal scans  this data set yielded twenty images
and associated labels  figure   below shows the expertdrawn image for the retinal scan shown in figure   
figure    expert drawing used for training labels

each pixel  the value is calculated as a function of the
rgb values from the raw image for each pixel using
the rgb gray function in matlab 
gradient magnitude  this value is calculated as the
norm of a vector containing the gradient of the image
in the x and y direction  it is used to detect edges in the
image  equation   below details the calculation for gradient magnitude an image  this calculation provides a
gradient magnitude value for every pixel in an image  
          

training labels were generated from figure   by assigning the value of    to pixels colored black     and   to
pixels colored white       
features  the retinal scan images above were used
to generate the following set of three features for each
pixel  these features were chosen to maximize the effectiveness of the models while limiting the number of
total features for speed of calculation  to limit noise in
these calculations  image processing was completed on
the raw images  specifically  images were resized  a
gaussian filter was applied  illumination effects were
removed  and rgb values were reduced to grayscale 
the data was taken from the pictorial form shown in
figures   and   to rgb values through the imread
function in matlab      these operations yielded
retinal image matrices with many noisy features removed  an example is shown in figure   below  based
off same image as figures   and    

eq   

the partial differentials appearing in equation   were
calculated for each gray scaled image matrix using the
imgradientxy function in matlab 
maximum eigenvalue of hessian matrix  determined
to be useful in image detection by prior research     
this value is calculated for each pixel using second derivatives of the matrix as shown in equation   below 
 
 
 
                         
 

eq   

the partial differentials appearing in equation   were
calculated for each gray scaled image matrix using
multiple iterations of the imgradientxy function in
matlab 
the procured retinal scan images contained         
pixel images  making         total pixels  each of
these pixels had an associated grayscale intensity  gradient magnitude  and maximum eigenvalue  therefore 
each of the    retinal scans was represented by        
separate      feature vectors

with these simplified images  various features were
tested for correlation with blood vessel locations  the
most effective three variables listed below proved to
yield the most accurate results while limiting the algorithmic complexity 
grayscale intensity  rgb values proved to be fairly
noisy  so the grayscale values represent the intensity of

svm analysis  to better understand current methods used to detect retinal blood vessels  svm analysis
was performed  the model was trained with the three
dimensional feature vectors and data set described in
previous sections  testing was conducted using cross
validation since a limited number of samples was available  svms fit this application well because they are
designed to maximize the margin between the positive
and negative examples  in this case  pixels that represent blood vessels and pixels that represent other parts
of the eye  
the svm was implemented on the image above by
solving the dual version of the regularization problem 
non symmetric regularization was added to combat
over fitting while maintaining control over the relative
numbers of false positives and false negatives  svmlight

eq   

the values of c  and c   were chosen such that the ratio
of c  to c   was equal to the number of true positive
values divided by the number of true negative values
as given by an expert drawing  various cost coefficient
inputs to the svmlight solver were tested in an attempt
to optimize the algorithm  since this application contains substantially more negative examples than positive examples  the value of c         was chosen to be
much smaller than c          
twenty images were available with hand drawn labels 
with such a small number of training examples  hold  out cross validation was used to train and test the
model for     combinations tested in total 
modified k nn analysis  the k nn algorithm
was modified to be unsupervised by randomly initializing a subset of pixels and their very near neighbors 
these clustered points were then used to begin the regular k nn algorithm  where each pixel is classified according to majority vote of its k nearest neighbors  
which was repeated until convergence  distance was
defined as shown equation   below 
             

eq   

the xs in this equation represent the feature vectors
associated with specific pixels  essentially equation  
calculates the distance between two pixels to be the
square root of the sum of squares of the difference between each feature of those pixels  this works well in
this case because typical feature values are all on the
same order of magnitude  the k nn algorithm ensures
that pixels that share the most similar features as measured by this metric will be grouped together 
to optimize this algorithm  three values were determined through trial and error  the number of points to
initially cluster  the number of nearest neighbors to
consider when initializing  and the total number of
nearest neighbors to consider when classifying pixels 
the first number of points to initially cluster and the
number of nearest neighbors to cluster along with these

initial points were set to minimize the number of iterations to convergence  the total number of iterations was
capped to ensure that the algorithm always produced a
result in a reasonable amount of time   a random selection of       pixels were randomly classified along
with their    nearest neighbors  this corresponds to
       out of               total pixels  once these
values are set  the k nn algorithm could be implemented normally 
the value of total number of neighbors to consider
when classifying pixels greatly affects both the accuracy and runtime of this algorithm  a value of    was
determined empirically while considering this tradeoff
between performance and speed  while this value results in a sub optimal runtime  it yields accuracy that is
slightly superior to existing svm methods 
once all of the clusters converged to the two classes of
vessel and non vessel  one post processing operation
was completed to ensure that the image produced
matched the dataset training label images  this operation involved setting the cluster with the larger number
of member pixels as the negative cluster  value of   
and the other cluster as the positive cluster  value of
      this ensured that the blood vessel predictions
would be white and the background would be black
since all retinal scans contain more non vessel pixels
than vessel pixels 
results  the svm was tested using hold two out
cross validation with    total images  the average
training error was       and the average testing error
was        the modified k nn algorithm was used to
evaluate the same    images  average testing error was

each of these models compared to the expert labels obtained from the data set

note that the svm model is      accurate in its general predictions  but when only considering whether a
pixel is representing a blood vessel  improvements can
be made as only     of positive labels were correctly
identified  similarly  the modified k nn model was
     accurate in general predictions  but correctly
classifies over     of the blood vessel pixels  figure  
below shows the prediction of the svm for the retinal

fiimage shown above in figures       and    figure

discussion  while the svm outperformed the knn algorithm in terms of average testing error  table  
reveals that the k nn algorithm more accurately identified blood vessel pixels  it essentially traded off false
positive predictions for true positive predictions  because about     of pixels are not blood vessels  this
tradeoff negatively impacted total accuracy more than
it improved blood vessel detection accuracy  this aggressive approach is evident when observing figures  
and    as the svm model predicts the major blood vessels but misses many of the small branches toward the
middle of the image  on the other hand  figure   reveals that the modified k nn model correctly predicts
many of the small branch blood vessels  but does so
while falsely predicting many more branches 
since the ultimate goal of this research is to automate
the diagnosis of eye diseases  it is difficult to tell which
algorithm is more useful in the long run  the modified
k nn model certainly identifies a higher percentage of
the pixels deemed to be blood vessels by the experts 
but it does so with a few major costs  first  as mentioned above  it sacrifices accuracy on the non blood
vessel pixels by predicting branches that dont actually
exist  second  because training data isnt used for this
model it takes a while to run for each image  in practices  the extended runtime could severely limit the effectiveness of the modified k nn algorithm  third  the
unsupervised approach is a bit tougher to adjust as the

only parameter that really affects the prediction is the
number of nearest neighbors considered for each pixel 
as this number is raised  the runtime increases but accuracy increases level off around    nearest neighbors 
the svm algorithm  while failing to meet the current
standards of blood vessel detection maintains a relatively small runtime for individual images and provides the requisite flexibility to change the output by
adjusting the cost parameters in the model  one downside of this approach is extensive amounts of time are
required to train the model on enough images to
achieve reasonable accuracy  this threshold number of
images can be quite high due to the high variance of
lighting between different retinal scans  all things considered  the modified k nn algorithm seems to work
better for this application  but the svm offers more potential for future improvement 
each of these algorithms could be improved by adding
more features to the feature vectors  however  this has
a dramatic downside due to the large number of pixels
in each image            additionally  there calculation of features that could be useful for this application
gets very complicated  online feature selection could
be used to efficiently find extra features      but it does
not address the efficiency issue that is pertinent to the
retinal blood vessel segmentation problem 
conclusions  in the big picture  the goal of this
research is to work toward a fully automated detection
process for various eye diseases  while the modified knn algorithm is slightly less accurate overall  it is
worth pursuing because it does not require a training
set  the downside of the modified k nn algorithm is
that it takes a relatively long time to run on each image
which might not be practical in the field  for this reason  it would be beneficial to further modify the presented svm or apply a different kind of unsupervised
algorithm to increase speed and accuracy 
future work  to improve upon the svm  a neural network scheme for pixel classification might be a
good direction to pursue given the algorithm s success
in various other image processing fields  in addition 
more work could be done to refine the features used to
improve accuracy of both models  full utilization of
the methods to segment retinal blood vessels described
in this paper will not be complete until they can work
in conjunction with some other software that helps to
diagnose the diseases of the eye  when this work is
more developed  the svm and modified k nn algorithms can be modified to yield more applicable results
