  introduction
predicting the outcome of national
football league games is a topic of
great interest to both fans and
gamblers  the vast majority of efforts
into this topic attempt to predict the
winner of each game or the margin of
victory  as a result of these efforts  the
las vegas odds and spread for
each game are very tough to beat  we
believe that the over under  a betting
line on the total number of points  is
more beatable in part because it is
less tried  furthermore  a prediction of
the total points scored is more
relevant than a prediction of the
winner to the fantasy football industry
 which has actually eclipsed the nfl
in revenue   because it is directly
correlated with the performance of
fantasy players  our target success
rate versus the vegas over under
line is        the break even point
versus typical handicapped odds  
 

  dataset

our data is statistics on nfl games
from the      to the      season 
each row in our data represents a
game played  and each column a

statistic of that game  our data has
various statistics for each game  only
a subset of which are of importance
for us  namely  we are interested in
the following  date of game  home
team  away team  home team score 
away team score  home team rushing
yards  away team rushing yards 
home team third down percentage 
away team third down percentage 
home team passing yards attempted 
home team passing yards completed 
away team passing yards attempted 
away team passing yards completed 
home team fumbles  and away team
fumbles 
we preprocessed the data  computed
pass completion percentage  which is
given by dividing the number of pass
completions by the number of pass
attempts  and total score  by taking
the sum of the home team score and
the away team score 

  features
we chose   key stat categories per
game that are not highly correlated 
 rd down percentage  rushing yards 
passing
completion
percentage 
passing yards  pass interceptions  and

fifumbles  our data contains the past
   seasons worth of games      
games   for each game and for each
stat category  we take   features 
home team performed  home team
allowed  away team performed  away
team allowed 

we ran a two layer neural network 
for our first layer  in order to predict a
particular statistic for any team in any
game  we look at the most recent   
games by that team  one nfl
season   we run a linear regression
on the same statistic for that team
looking at the past    values of that
statistic in order to predict the next
one  we ran    linear regressions on
our train data to produce    weights
vectors  of size     for each of the   
feature types    stat categories x  
allowed performed  

for example  for the rushing yards
stat category  we have rushing yards
the home team performed  rushing
yards the home team allowed  rushing
yards the away team performed  and
the rushing yards the away team
allowed 
for
interceptions
and
fumbles  the terms performed and
allowed are counterintuitive  to
clarify 
performed
refers
to
interceptions thrown or fumbles made
and allowed refers to interceptions
thrown or fumbles made by the other
team 

we used the aforementioned weights
to compute predicted statistics of each
game of both our train and test data 
in our second layer  we then used
these predicted statistics for each
game as our input  and output whether
the total points scored would be over
or under the las vegas line for the
game 

   stat categories  x    each team  x  
 allowed performed       intercept
term       total features per game

we made this over or under
prediction
using
three
different
methods  our first was least squares
linear regression with stochastic
gradient descent  we computed the
predicted score for each game  and
then appropriately chose over or
under relative to the vegas line 

  models

our second method was logistic
regression with stochastic gradient
descent  in order to fit this model  we
appended the vegas line as an extra
feature     features   we then directly
predicted the over or under 
 

fisimilarly  we also used an svm to
directly predict over or under for
each game 

prediction on the data only if we could
ensure a certain degree of confidence
on the result  if the magnitude of the
difference between the vegas line and
our predicted score exceeded our
confidence  we made a prediction 
we ran this model for a confidence of
  points and a confidence of   points 

in addition to these methods  we
attempted an alternative strategy
using linear regression to further
improve our results  we only made a

  as explained in the next section  any success rate       is a good result
these results it is necessary to state
that beating the las vegas line is very
difficult  while random guessing will
result in a     success rate  very
sophisticated models will struggle to
do much better  a model needs a
reliable success rate of over       to
be
profitable
against
typical
handicapped odds offered 

  discussion
we ran the entire neural network
repeatedly using a random     of the
data for training each time to get the
average results in the previous
section 
first we will discuss the results from
layer   of the neural network  the
average weights for the past   
games tended to decrease as the
number of games ago increases  this
makes intuitive sense that when
making a prediction it matters more
what happened on the most recent
game than    games ago  this
decreasing trend was most present for
the stat types
rushing yards
performed  rushing yards allowed 
passing yards performed  and passing
yards allowed  it was least present for
the stat types interceptions performed 
interceptions
allowed 
fumbles
performed  and fumbles allowed all of
which had more random weights 

it is immediately clear from the results
that neither logistic regression nor the
svm were effective  both had a test
success rate slightly worse than
random guessing        linear
regression  which doesnt predict
over or under directly  had much
better results 
the linear regression had a decent
test success rate of         despite
being an improvement from random
guessing  this rate is below our target
of        however  if we run linear
regression and only make a prediction
if our output differs from the line by at
least   or at least   we get better
results  for the fraction of examples
predicted on   a confidence of   yields
a test success rate of        and a
confidence of   a test success rate of

layer   of the neural network
predicted over or under on each
game versus the line using several
different models  before discussing
 

fi        the latter exceeds the target
success rate 

specifically  in any given game it is
critical to know whether certain key
players are playing  incorporating
player data will likely require an
entirely new model 

  conclusions
passing yards and rushing yards are
best predicted weighting recent data
more heavily whereas interceptions
and fumbles require more evenly
weighted data  furthermore  linear
regression using predicted stats is
much more effective at beating the
over under than both logistic
regression and an svm using the
same stats  by predicting on only the
     of games we are most confident
on  we found that we can achieve a
profitable model versus the vegas
over under line with handicapped
odds

  future work
for further work  the first thing we
would do is relook at our feature set  a
lot of nfl stat categories are very
correlated and because of this we
chose the least correlated and most
relevant ones using just our football
knowledge  various feature selection
algorithms could help choose better
stat categories  such as forward
search 
while feature selection algorithms on
team stats may make an impact  we
believe that to get much better results
data on individual players needs to be
used  looking at team statistics only
works so well when the players in the
games are constantly changing
