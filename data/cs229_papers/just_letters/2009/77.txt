predictions and rankings in college football

introduction

college football is one of the most heavily attended sports leagues in world  with over   
million in attendance over the course of the season  in the past  the national champion
was decided solely by polls  but after several seasons of multiple undefeated teams  the
ncaa instituted the bowl championship series  where the top two teams face off in a
national championship game  the top teams are decided by a combination of human
polls and computer rankings  making it a unique situation where computer algorithms
can directly affect the outcomes of a season 
given the physical demands of the sport  teams can only play one game per week  so
throughout the entire season  teams play at most    games  including championship
games  and with over a hundred teams contending for the national title  it is not uncommon for there to be controversy over who deserves the title 
in the past  computer rankings in the bcs took margin of victory into consideration  but
the bcs has gradually removed such rankings from the system  arguing that the objective
of the game is defeat the opponent and not to score as many points as possible against
weaker opposition  which is considered bad sportsmanship  it is thus of great interest to
find methods of consistently ranking teams based on the results of relatively few matches 

 

data

the data was taken from james howells college football scores website      which has
the scores for every game in which at least one of the teams was in the football bowl
subdivision  broken down by season  since the bcs does not allow computer ranking
systems to consider margin of victory  the main approach used here will only consider the
wins and losses and not the scores 
each season is approximately     games between     different teams  so each team can
be identified by   bits and the outcome of a game can be represented by   bit  so conservatively  this is at most      bytes of data  which makes it a challenge to extract meaningful
results

bradley terry model
description

the bradley terry model     assumes that each team has a strength parameter i and
i
with independent
the probability of that team i winning a game against team j is i 
j
outcomes  with a vector of strength parameters   we can calculate the likelihood of the
outcome of any game and also calculate the likelihood function given a set of outcomes as
the product of all the individual outcomes  the estimates for the strength parameters is
then the maximum likelihood estimator based on the outcomes during the season  these
estimates can then be used to rank the teams as well as a probabilistic prediction for any
matchup 

   

implementation

this was implemented in matlab  using constrained numerical optimzation of the loglikelihood function  the constraints were set such that the strength of each team was
bounded between      and       since mle would give estimates of   or infinity if left
unconstrained 

   

results

the mle yields reasonable rankings when compared to the consensus rankings      which
are compiled by kenneth massey from the results of over a hundred ranking systems 
including both mathematical systems and human polls  the idea is that if ranking systems
have errors that are not strongly correlated  then the consensus result would have a much
lower error than the individual results  and the best rankings are the ones that are most
highly correlated with those results  in       the bradley terry model had   of the top
   teams in common with the consensus rankings  and in       the bradley terry model
had all of the top    teams the consensus 
at first  there were quite a few teams from lower divisions which topped the rankings with
    records  so the rankings were recompiled after removing teams that had played less
than   games to filter out teams that were not in the fbs  this filter worked effectively
to provide solid rankings  but it is more of a workaround  another solution was to run the
algorithm on results from all divisions to acquire a more complete picture  but the lack
of connectivity between teams caused any improvements in rankings to be overshadowed
by the introduction of more weak undefeated teams 

 
   

maximum a posteriori estimation
motivation

although the results using the mle were reasonably consistent  there are two major
flaws with the method  the most obvious flaw is that under mle  undefeated teams

  indicates that the strength parameter was at the upper bound of the constraint
will be estimated at infinity if unconstrained and winless teams will be estimated at zero 
this implies that teams that go undefeated against weak opponents will always be ranked
higher than teams that have lost while facing strong opponents  as discussed in detail in
the previous section  it also implies that there is no way to differentiate between teams
which are undefeated  the second flaw is that any scalar multiple of a vector will have
the same likelihood  so the results arent unique  with the map estimation  the results
will be regularized by the prior distribution  eliminating the problems above 
the prior distribution chosen for the model is the lognormal distribution  this bounds
the estimates to positive values and assigns low probabilities to both very low and very
high estimates  the lognormal distribution is defined by parameters  and   and changes
in  only affect the estimates by a constant factor and thus have no effect on the estimated rankings or probability estimates  the value of     for  was chosen after some
experimentation  but the choice does not have a large impact on the results 

   

results

the rankings using map estimation are much more robust than before  and there is no
need for the filter used in the previous section  the teams that have only played a single
game are estimated to be close to the median strength  a much more reasonable estimate
than the extremes  this also removed the need for constraints during optimization  the
results from using a lognormal prior are shown in table   
there are other distributions to be considered  so the model was rerun with logistic 
normal and exponential priors  the results are fairly similar  as none of the distributions
showed a significant difference in rankings for the vast majority of teams  the lognormal
prior  however  has the least inconsistencies where teams are far displaced from their rank
in the polls  making it the most accurate result 
after comparing the different implementations against the consensus results  there appear
to be two major factors causing the discrepancies  first  the models  be it mle or map 
overemphasize wins and losses  making it very difficult for teams with more losses to be

higher in the rankings despite facing tougher opposition  also  the models do not consider
the date on which games were played  in sequential update systems and human polls  a
greater weight is put on more recent results  while it can be argued that such a weighting
only increases the variance of the results  it also reflects the reality that team strengths
change over time as they practice and make adjustments throughout the season or as
injuries occur 
from the histograms of parameter estimates in figures   and    we can see that there is a
lot of separation for the top teams  but the rest of the teams all have very low estimated
strengths  it is also significant that the distribution of map estimates does not appear
to be lognormal  the distribution of the prior  this indicates that perhaps an entirely
different probabilistic model would provide more accurate results 

 

conclusion

the final model provides a fairly accurate method of ranking college football teams with
very little data  the use of map estimates significantly increases the robustness of
the model over mle  especially in situations where teams are not well connected or
 

fithere are not many results  such as early in the season  this model can adapted as a
ranking system in many situations with paired comparisons  particularly when sequential
updating systems do not learn fast enough  there are  however  consistent discrepancies
between the model and the consensus rankings where future work can be done  possible
modifications include weighting by time  using a prior based on expert knowledge  and a
different probabilistic framework
