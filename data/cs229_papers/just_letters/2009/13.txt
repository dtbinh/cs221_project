abstract  we present a real time recommendation system for photo annotation that can be
used in flickr  we start with a database of       images and    carefully chosen tags  we first
extract global features that represent the shape of the image  we then train one classifier per tag
to detect if the tag is relevant  each classifier makes use of a fisher kernel followed by a support
vector machine  to obtain the fisher kernel  we train a gaussian mixture model  gmm  on the
data  for computational feasibility  we approximate the fisher information matrix by considering
only the diagonal elements  finally  for each test image  we sort the soft scores of the classifiers to
rank the tags by relevancy  we compute performance metrics and compare them with previously
published results  finally we suggest possible future directions

introduction

in recent years  tagging   the act of adding keywords  tags  to objects   has become a popular
means to annotate various web resources  such as web page bookmarks  academic publications  and
multimedia objects  the tags provide meaningful descriptors of the objects  and allow the user to
organise and index her content  this becomes even more important  when dealing with multimedia
objects that provide little or no textual context  such as bookmarks  photos and videos 
tags may be recommended for images based either on related tags that have been previously
applied to the image or on features that are extracted from an image  the former language based
approach can be applied only to images that have been tagged previously  one has to rank the
recommendations based on how closely they relate to the applied tags      the latter approach 
though error prone  can be applied even when the image is not tagged before 
in      the authors describe gist in which they represent global features using a very lowdimensional representation  termed spatial envelope  of the image 
in      the authors present a method to extract the signal present in collaborative communities
in order to extract knowledge about tag usage  it describes methods to categorize sets of tags as
places  landmarks  and visual descriptors  they use clustering of visual features followed by mutual
information measurement to predict tags that can be learnt from visual features 
we built a recommendation system that identifies relevant tags based on visual features extracted by gist  fig    shows an example of our tag recommendation system in action 
for our work  we used the mir flickr data set     this image collection consists of      
images that were downloaded from the social photography site flickr com through its public api

figure   
the color images are representative of a generic domain and are of high quality  this is guaranteed
by the high interestingness  http   www flickr com explore interesting   of the images 
this image score represents an evolving measure of quality determined by factors such as where
clickthroughs on the image are coming from  who comments on it and when  or who marks the
image as a favorite 
the rest of the report is structured as follows  in section    we describe our dataset and the
feature extraction algorithm  in section    we describe implementation of the classifier  in section
   we discuss results and compare our algorthim with prior work  in section    we conclude and
suggest future directions 

 

feature extraction and tag selection

the mir flickr data set contains a set of    most commonly occuring tags  surprisingly  only
   of the       images cannot be described by any tag with this limited vocabulary 
we extract global features of the image using gist      it has been proven to perform well in
scene classification with a overall accuracy of       
we computed the mutual information between each tag and the visual features extracted by
gist as described in      the lowest mutual information was      bits for dog and the highest was
     bits for clouds  due to high mutual information  it seemed reasonable that all    tags can be
used for classification

training a gmm

we represent each image by its    dimensional feature vector extracted via gist  as usual  we
split the data in to     training and     test set 
we begin by performing a pca to reduce the dimensionality of the data to     we find that
more than     of the variance is in the first    dimensions 
next  we fit a gmm to the visual features using k      gaussians  we follow     when we
restrict the covariance of the distribution to be diagonal 

   

fisher kernel

the fisher kernel function is given by
g x    f      log p x   
where f   ex   log p x       log p x    t is the fisher information matrix  again  as suggested in      we approximate f by a diagnoal matrix 
the fisher kernel approach combines a generative model  fitting a gmm  with a discriminative
model  svm classifier  

   

final svm classifier

once the kernel transformation is complete  we build one svm per tag to detect if the tag is
relevant  finally we sort the soft scores produced by the svm to rank the recommended tags by
relevancy

performance

we first define some performance metrics for a tag recommendation system 
 mean reciprocal rank  mrr   average of the reciprocal rank of the most relevant tag
in the ranked list 
 success k  probability that atleast one among the tags ranked k or better is relevant 
 precision k  probability that a tag ranked k or better is a potential tag 
we report mrr  success    success   and precision   for our vision based algorithm and compare it with the reference algorthim presented in

note that     presents a language based algorithm which is generally known to outperform any
vision based approach  however  our algorithm seems to compare reasonably well with the languagebased algorithm 

 

future work

though gist extracts global visual features amazingly well  it does not identify local features
which can often determine tags  for example  tags like cloud and sea are easy to recommend
while tags like animals and dogs are far difficult  however  learning local features requires image
segmentation which cannot be accomplished easily in real time  one suggestion is to divide the
image in to   quadrants and perform tag recommendation on each quadrant independently  then
the soft scores in each quadrant can be added and the tags can be ranked accordingly 
a second approach is to use the output of the vision based approach as an input to a languagebased approach and determine recommend co occuring tags  e g  jackard coefficient   this is
different from conventional approaches where the language based approach runs in parallel to the
vision based approach  it helps to improve the tag vocabulary while retaining a low vocabulary
that is crucial for a vision based approach to succeed
