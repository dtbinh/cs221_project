introduction

cancer affects people of all ages worldwide and can afflict many different parts of the body  it is one of the
leading causes of death in the world  accounting for     of all deaths and has a mortality rate of approximately one
hundred deaths per         population  an individuals specific configuration of dna  genotype  influences
susceptibility to cancer by modulating the effects of environmental factors  affecting an individuals behavior  and
also by altering normal biological functions of the body  naturally  many extensive genome wide association studies
 gwas  of variability have been performed that attempt to associate specific genomic variations with cancer 
however  due to technical limitations  those studies have focused on the evaluation of variations that occur
commonly within a population while ignoring equally potent individual specific variations  private variations  
more specifically the dominant technology for measuring single nucleotide polymorphisms  snps  in the genome 
microarray snp chips  have a limited number  between         and            of static  pre selected snps that it
can detect in a genome  thus  the size of snp microarray chips limit us to the evaluation of a subset of the estimated
    million snps that occur in any individuals genome  furthermore  as the set of target snps that a chip is able to
detect is fixed  they are unable to detect variations unique to an individual  many experts have attributed the
marginal success of gwas studies to the limited scope of variation analyzed with these chips     
recent advances in sequencing technologies  specifically whole genome sequencing  have enabled the study of
disease association with an individual s complete genotype  using an individuals complete genetic sequence to
correlate mutations with disease risk would allow us to find rarer  private variations that affect risk and likely
contribute much more to susceptibility than previously identified common variants  thus  as full genome
sequencing becomes cheaper and easier  methods for variation analysis should shift their focus from analysis of
common snps to and leverage the entirety of genomic variation  the method presented here takes such an approach
and our aims are as follows 
   use supervised learning to build a model of cancer relevant snps using a range of variation topographical 
chemical  and functional features 
   evaluate method accuracy by validating model against known cancer relevant snps 
   identify cancer relevant private snps in a newly sequenced genome using our model 
  

materials and methods

     training data
as with any supervised learning problem  building a model of a cancer relevant snp and its validation requires
substantial training data  to assemble such data  we extracted       cancer associated snps from two manually
curated variations databases  the human gene mutation database  hgmd      and the swiss var component of the
uniprot knowledgebase      both of these repositories are populated with variations extracted from literature where
the variant has been show to be statistically correlated with disease  as such  these variations were considered our
gold standard for both training and validation of our model  all variations in our aggregated training data encoded
different amino acids than the reference base  non synonymous snps  and we were therefore limited to the
classification of non synonymous snps in our target genome 
in addition to our positive training set  we extracted        neutral polymorphisms from the swiss var
database  these non synonymous mutations had not been associated with any diseases and were used as our
negative training set

fi 
     features
for each snp  we extracted a variety of features including cancer relevant functional associations  involvement
in known cancer pathways  and variation of amino acid physiochemical properties 
snp functional associations are binary features indicating whether a snp is present in transcripts that have a
functional role in cancer relevant processes  to calculate these features  we mapped each snp to corresponding
coding transcripts  extracted transcript gene ontology  go      annotations from the ensembl genome database
     and determined if the associated transcript was involved in any of the following biological processes or
subprocesses  response to tumor  go           apoptosis  go           regulation of cell cycle
 go           or dna repair  go           it naturally follows that the successful determination of these
features relies heavily on the availability of correct  complete annotation of genes by go terms 
we included another binary feature indicating whether each snp is present in a gene known to be part of an
established cancer pathway  to calculate this feature  we used the ensembl perl api to map each snp to
corresponding coding transcripts and map transcripts to genes  we then cross referenced these genes against all
genes in all known cancer pathways from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  kegg       the utility
of this feature is dependent on the availability of previously annotated and correct descriptions of cancer pathways 
finally  for each snp we calculated basic physiochemical differences between the encoded wild type amino
acid and variation encoded amino acid  these features include change in amino acid polarity  change in amino acid
hydrophobicity  grantham matrix score  a score quantifying differences between any two amino acids       and
transformation of an amino acid encoding codon to a stop codon  these features  although not specific to cancer 
were included because they are easily computable for all amino acids and are not dependent on prior manually
curated data 
     model building
       feature selection
a common problem when building a classifier is the use of correlated features that make the model overly
sensitive to specific factors  to avoid this problem  we applied correlated feature selection  cfs  to our   features in
order to discover any redundant information within our feature set  next  we evaluated each feature independently to
determine their respective predictive powers  finally  although issues of dimensionality and overfitting can
potentially occur when building models from many features  our low feature set to training set size ratio minimizes
the risks of these effects 
       classifier selection
using our training data  calculated features  and the weka machine learning software framework      we
constructed four models of a cancer relevant snp  we first used wekas j   decision tree learner with pruning and
boosting  next  we trained a support vector machine  svm  using the smo algorithm  for our svm  we used a
standard linear kernel due to the linear nature of our features  finally  we tested two types of bayesian classifiers 
the simple to train nave bayes classifier and the more powerful bayes net classifier  of note  all our features besides
the grantham matrix score do not have any immediately known relationships and accordingly the bayes net
classifier performed similarly to nave bayes classifier 
for each of these classifiers  we trained a model using our cancer associated snp training set described in
section      performed    fold cross validation on each model  and use roc curves to evaluate the performance of
each model  we evaluated each models performance and ultimately chose the nave bayes classifier to identify
cancer relevant snps in the recently sequenced genome of a male of european decent  hereafter referred to as p 
    

fi 
     application to p  snps
having trained a model for cancer relevant snps  we next sought to identify potentially deleterious private nonsynonymous coding snps in the p  genome  to establish our subset of snps for classification  we first started with
the set of all     million p  snps as provided by the team that assembled the p  genome  in order to remove
population common variants  we leveraged knowledge of common patterns of human genetic variation as
established by the international hapmap project  we removed all p  snps corresponding to snps established by
the international hapmap project as having a population prevalence greater than       removal of population
common variants left     million private snps  next  non coding snps were eliminated by mapping all private
snps to the ncbi v   human reference genome using the ensembl core perl api  snps that failed to map to
coding regions of transcripts were removed  leaving        private coding snps  finally  we computed variation
effects of coding private snps using the ensembl variation api  synonymous snps were removed  leaving us
with a final total of       private non synonymous coding variations for classification  post extraction  each snp
was classified using our trained nave bayes classifier and cancer relevance was assessed 
  

results

     feature evaluation and classifier performance
       feature selection
using cfs  we found no correlations among our features and thus chose to use all of them when building our
model  results of our evaluation of feature predictive power are shown in table    this evaluation revealed that cell
cycle  member of cancer pathway  and dna repair were the most informative of our features  other functional
properties  such as tumor response and apoptosis  effectively had no predictive power because none of our training
snps were functionally mapped to these categories via go annotations

       model evaluation
we performed    fold cross validation on each one of our classifiers in training  the results are summarized in
table    the two bayes methods performed best in auc and sensitivity  while the decision tree and svm were both
more specific  we chose to use nave bayes as our final classifier  as it had the highest sensitivity among the
classifiers we used  and the second highest auc  the specificity was above      so we can be reasonably confident
of our positive predictions  we determined the learning curves for several of our classifiers as a final test for bias
and variance problems  neither bias nor variance was significant issues for any of the classifiers 
finally  as a sanity check  we classified hgmd diabetes mutations with a nave bayes classifier trained on our
gold standard cancer snps  as expected  we have less than     sensitivity for predicting diabetes with our
classifier  which demonstrates its specificity to cancer

     identifying novel snps
using our nave bayes classifier  we predicted with confidence greater than     that     private  nonsynonymous snps in the p  genome have potential cancer relevance  of these     variations      changed an
amino acid encoding codon to a stop codon     occurred within known cancer pathway genes     occurred within
genes involved in cell cycle regulation  and    occurred within dna repair genes  additionally  of the      
training snps extracted from hgmd     were found to occur within the p  genome     of which we successfully
re predicted  factors contributing to low recall of our gold standard snps are examined in the discussion section 
  

discussion

using our nave bayes classifier  we were only able to re predict correctly    of the    snps that were included
in both p  s genome and our gold standard for cancer associated mutations  however  these results are actually quite
promising given that our model has       specificity  the high specificity of our model gives great confidence that
any mutation our classifier predicts as being cancer associated is not a false positive  which is important in the
context of identifying candidates for biological exploration  pursuing any of these candidates further would require
significant effort both in terms of time and funds  so ensuring the quality of these results is essential 
looking in further detail at putative cancer relevant private snps  it is straightforward to hypothesize about the
detrimental effects of these mutations and how they might contribute to cancer susceptibility  a mutation on
chromosome    at base            changes an encoded amino acid from valine to alanine in the bone
morphegenetic protein   gene  bmp   protein product  this mutation occurs within a transformation growth factor
domain and could potentially alter the protein s ability to control cell proliferation and differentiation  furthermore 
other mutations in bmp  have been shown to cause defects during eye  brain  and digit development      
another mutation on chromosome    at base            changes a leucine encoding codon to a stop codon in
the cell division cycle protein     cdc    gene product  this mutation reduces the encoded peptide to     amino
acids from     and eliminates the presence of a tetratrico peptide repeat domain at the c terminus of the peptide 
thus altering the protein product to properly bind with other proteins and accordingly  mediate cell division  such
results give us confidence that variations identified as deleterious by our method are biologically relevant 

fi 
through analysis of our selected features and their predictive power for cancer susceptibility  we found that
there appears to be a tradeoff between the information content of a feature and its ease of obtainment  we can make
the best predictions when we know whether or not the mutation was part of a transcript involved in cell cycle
regulation or dna repair or was a member of a known cancer pathway because those three features had the highest
accuracy and sensitivity when they were used individually to predict cancer risk  we attribute the high information
content of these features to the central nature of these processes to all cancers  unfortunately  because these features
are dependent on human annotation  they were inconsistent in availability due to incomplete genomic annotation 
surprisingly  some of the features that we hoped would be informative did not contribute to the accuracy of our
classifier  those features which have an auc        when evaluated individually essentially provide the same
amount of information as random chance  so mutations involved in tumor response and apoptosis were not any more
likely to be predicted as cancer associated than mutations without these functional properties  on closer examination
however  we found that this lack of predictive power occurs because there are almost no snps associated with either
of these two properties in our training data sets  only one of our training cancer snps is associated with apoptosis
and none of our training cancer snps were associated with tumor response  we do not know for sure whether these
features could improve our results given more complete gene annotation  but based on results for our other
functionally defined features  we believe that they are still promising candidates for prediction 
  

conclusions and future work

despite inherent data biases  our method successfully leverages the entire genome in order to provide
personalized  highly specific analysis of an individuals private mutations  our method allowed us to identify    
putative cancer relevant snps in the p  genome that are similar to our training set in terms of the defined feature
set  these high confidence predictions serve as an excellent starting point for further biological exploration 
functional associations and other cancer specific features had among the highest information content  but their
predictive powers were hampered by incomplete annotations  future iterations of our method will could avoid such
biases of manual curation by incorporating more complex yet universally computable features such as snp presence
within conserved structural domains 
finally  given the     putative cancer relevant snps  there is currently no way for us to quantify risk conferred
by each variation given our available training data  to enable such analyses in the future  models of cancer relevant
snps should be partially derived from variations present in the genomes of well documented cancer patients  given
the technology used to sequence the genome of p   such data should be available within a few years  much in the
same way that full genome sequencing has enabled more specific  personal analyses of variation versus disease  so
too will it enable better models of deleterious variation through the availability of full genomic sequences of
diseased patients
