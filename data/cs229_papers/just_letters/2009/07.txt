abstract
an asset allocation framework decomposes the universe of asset returns into factors either by
fundamental analysis  factor analysis or principal component analysis  asset allocation methods
then attempt to neutralize the sensitivity of the portfolio to a select factor  however  factor analysis or
pca fail to take into account moments higher than the second moment  this paper outlines a method
based on independent component analysis to effectively neutralize a portfolio to a component  this
method is illustrated for building a market neutral portfolio in the mean variance framework  and can
be extended to encompass any factor s  

 

introduction

capital asset pricing model  capm  postulates that any stock return can be decomposed into a linear
combination of a return component correlated to the market portfolio and an idiosyncratic component  this
simplified model can be used to design a portfolio which is insensitive to market gyrations  but still has a
positive return  a simplified example is the pairs trading method  a pair of highly correlated stocks are
chosen and the trader goes long the cheaper stock and short the expensive stock to create a market neutral
pair  this pair has zero correlation with the market  the method of pairs trading can be generalized to
create a linear combination of arbitrary stocks which gives a net market exposure of zero 
the pairs trading method can be generalized by decomposing a stock specific return into various factors 
the factors could be fundamentals based  which include for instance  market capitalization  industry sector 
rankings  analyst ratings etc  or the factors can be determined by statistical techniques like factor analysis 
principal component analysis  pca  to determine the dominant return factors  then a portfolio manager
can neutralize his her portfolio to a chosen factor based on his her beliefs or alpha model  this is achieved
by the portfolio optimization technique which minimizes the variance of the returns of the portfolio for a
desired return  under the budget and factor neutrality constraints 
the method of using pca with variance minimization considers only the first two moments  mean and
variance  factor analysis makes a gaussian assumption which is routinely violated by the stock returns 
the market returns are negatively skewed and fat tailed  we saw an evidence of the higher moments in the
past year        when the market neutral hedge funds suffered with the drop in the market 
to overcome the gaussian distribution assumption  this paper proposes to modify the method of extracting
factors using independent component analysis to decompose the stock returns into factors  the resulting
factors would be from independent distributions and not just uncorrelated  then using mutual information
as a metric of similarity the independent factor corresponding to market would be identified and used as a
 

ficonstraint in portfolio optimization  the resulting return profile is shown to be independent of the market
by using the mutual information metric 
the next section describes existing work in explaining stock returns by means of independent component
analysis  the followng section describes the data used for the study  which is followed by a simplified
mean variance optimization solution  we then describe the pca and ica formulations which are followed
by the evidence based on our analysis of the stock returns data  the analysis section demonstrates the
ineffectiveness of neutralizing the portfolio to the market using only the second moments  additionally by
using ica it demonstrates the market neutrality of the resulting portfolio weights 

 

existing work

back and weigend in     made first use of independent component analysis in analysing stock returns  they
applied it to the daily returns of the    of the largest japanese stocks and used ica factors as explanatory
variables for the stock market  a very similar approach was used by siu ming cha and lai wan chan in    
to analyze the returns of the hang sheng market  their primary purpose too was to explain the underlying
data generating process of the stock returns  an innovative use of ica to analyze hedge fund returns can
be found in     where jan uses ica to explain the factors driving the hedge fund returns of a select group
of hedge fund managers and demonstrates superiority over using pca for attribution analysis  analysis of
s p    returns in     about the non normality of stock returns by weigend et al serves as the motivation
for this paper 

 

data

the data used for this problem was obtained from the fama french website      the website contains daily
returns for a set of ten portfolios which seggregate the us stock universe based on the size of the companies 
each one of these portfolios is treated as one asset for the purpose of this paper  the market returns are
determined by the daily returns on the index spy and downloaded from yahoo  the period of study is
from february         to september          

 

a note on mutual information metric

as the goal of this project is to demonstrate that the resulting distribution of returns is independent of
the market returns  we need a metric that will work on distributions  kolmogorov smirnov  ks  test can
be used to compare distributions  however it can not determine whether the given distribution is part of
the mixture  kullback leibler  kl  divergence would tell us if the two distributions are independent  but
the kl divergence can not be used as a metric since it does not obey triangle inequality  which prevents
it from being used to compare non zero kl divergences  there is a method based on kl divergence  the
mutual information metric     which obeys triangle inequality  and is a true metric  this is the method we
use in this paper as this allows us to determine when two distributions are independent and if they are not
independent  the one with the larger metric shows greater dependence

modern portfolio theory

asset allocation in the modern portfolio theory     is achieved by determining the weights on each of the
assets to maximize the total return while minimizing the risk under a given budget constraint  for a
vector of portfolio weights of assets denoted by w  return vector r  asset covariance matrix   the portfolio
optimization is defined as a solution to 
min wt w  rt w
st 

m
x

     

wi    

i  

the covariance matrix is created by cov r   where r is a matrix of return vectors corresponding to each
asset  additional constraints can be included in       based on the portfolio design requirements 

 

principal component analysis

for pca we determine the zero based auto correlation matrix and then use the princomp in matlab to
determine the components  we form portfolios corresponding to each one of the principal components and
compare the returns of these portfolios to the market portfolio using the mutual information metric  the
component with the largest mutual information  the largest eigenvalue  corresponds to the market  we
modify       to include this constraint 
rt wpca i     
which indicates that the returns corresponding to this component have to be zero  we then determine the
returns of the optimized portfolio and compute the efficient frontier  the set of returns computed are once
again compared to the market using the mutual information metric  we find the mutual information to be
non zero in this case indicating that the returns are not indepdent of the market 

 

independent component analysis

while there are several algorithms for independent component analysis  we use the fastica algorithm  we
compute the independent components and determine the component corresponding to the market portfolio
based on the mututal information metric  this is used to add the constraint to the       
rt wica i     
we once again compute the efficient frontier of the new portfolio using ica  we determine the mutual
information of the returns of the ica portfolio and compare it to the mutual information of the returns of
the pca 

 

method and results

this section illustrates the comparison of the efficient frontier obtained by the three methods  unconstrained
optimization  optimization with the domiant pca eigenvector set to zero and optimization with the
 

fidominant ica component set to zero  the choice of the component to neutralize for both ica and pca
was made by picking the component which had the highest mutual information with the returns to the
market  the constraint was implemented by regenerating the returns matrix by multiplying the original
returns matrix with a mixing matrix which had the dominant column set to zero for pca and the dominant
row set to zero for ica 
as expected  the pca based returns have non zero mutual information when compared to the market 
however  the mutual information of ica constrained portfolio based returns is still non zero albeit much
lower than the pca based portfolio for the same level of returns  another observation from the plots is
that the possible risk and returns from the ica constrained portfolio are higher than the possible risk and
returns from the pca constrained portfolio indicating that there is improvement to be gained by using an
ica based method 
the efficient frontier shows that the returns from the unconstrained portfolio are higher than the constrained
returns owing the presence of the market which is expected since the ica and pca portfolios cant make
use of the market  a striking result of the efficient frontier is that the unconstrained results have a minimum
with respect to the mutual information to the market which indicates another possibility of achieving a
market neutral portfolio  to test this  we tried optimizing the orignal equation       with the constraint
that the mutual information with respect to the market be zero and that fails to converge in matlab 

 

conclusion

this paper illustrates a method for creating a generalized neutral portfolio to a component based on using
indepdent component analysis as a constraint in the markowitz portfolio theory framework  the resulting
portfolio returns are evaluated for their mutual information with the market and the results from an ica
based constraint have lower mutual information with the market when compared to a pca based constraint 
furthermore  ica based results give access to a higher range of return risk values than the pca based
methods enabling higher returns from existing portfolios  this kind of portfolio formulation can be extended
to include any other factor or a set of factors  an added benefit of this formulation is that when we remove
the exposure to market distribution  we greatly reduce the higher moment exposure to our portfolio without
directly optimizing for it  this is something that we expect to demonstrate in future work
