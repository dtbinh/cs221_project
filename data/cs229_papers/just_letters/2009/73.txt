introduction

 
   

the general consensus is that if you want to know
someones age  you would just ask that person  however  some unscrupulous people might lie about their
age and even falsify birth records for personal gain 
this problem is somewhat pervasive in professional
sports today  during the      summer olympics in
beijing  there was a huge controversy over the ages of
the female chinese gymnasts  professional baseball
prospects in other countries falsify their birth certificates to appear younger than they really are in order
to seem more attractive to mlb scouts  there is a
lack of simple tests or techniques that could definitively verify someones age  the aging process is still
not well understood  to date  there are no accurate
predictive models of biological aging in adult human
populations 

 

methods
data

data from nhanes was used to test and validate
the aging models  the national health and nutrition examination survey  nhanes  is a series
of interviews and physical examinations that help
evaluate the health and nutritional status of both
children and adults in the united states  a part
of the centers for disease control and prevention
 cdc   nhanes surveys a sample of      people
that tries to accurately represent the nations demographic  the survey process first includes an interview with demographic  socioeconomic  dietary  and
health related questions  that information is then
supplemented by a physical examination and laboratory tests to attain medical  dental  and physiological
measurements  nhanes data from           was
used  people aged       were classified as young 
and people aged       were classified as old  any
data with missing elements was thrown out to avoid
data imputation 

background

currently  there is no widely accepted predictive
model for human biological aging  some researchers
have used biomarker data to build such a model
with moderate success           fliss et al  used age 
gender  and blood biomarker information to build a
model for aging using statistical techniques on the
national health and nutrition examination survey
 nhanes  data      chen et al  used least angle
regression to reduce the number of features in their
model of aging in pediatric patients     

   

model selection

weka  waikato environment for knowledge analysis   a machine learning software that features an
abundance of algorithms  was used for the preliminary data analysis  wekas user friendly gui and
relative ease of use was optimal for experimenting
and fast prototyping  weka was used to visualize the
nhanes data set first  then  many of the machine
 

filearning algorithms available in weka were used on
the nhanes           data set and each algorithm
was evaluated using    fold cross validation  some of
the classifiers that were experimented with were naive
bayes  support vector machines  logistic regression 
adaboost  and random forests  the classifier with
the highest predictive accuracy was chosen  in this
case  accuracy is defined as the number of correctly
classified instances in the data set  this method was
used to select the classifiers for both the male and
female models 

   

actually performed better with only   biomarkers
than with all    features   tables     

 

the male and female logistic regression models both
performed surprisingly well  remarkably  the male
model was able to classify age with only   biomarkers with     accuracy  the top biomarker for each
model was alkaline phosphatase  which is present in
children in higher levels  height  weight  and body
mass index also showed up in the top    features according to information gain for males  this makes
sense since height  weight  and bmi tend to correlate with age  especially in children  the male model
probably performed better than the female model due
to the cutoff point for the two age groups  males generally end adolescence and enter young adulthood
around     while females usually complete puberty
before     the female model might perform better
if the age cutoff were changed to     these models
are both pretty accurate and sensible  they provide
us with some insight into the biological changes that
take place from adolescence to young adulthood 

feature selection

there were initially    biomarkers in the feature set 
it is inconvenient to use so many biomarkers to predict age  thus  feature selection was used to reduce
the feature set to a more manageable size  information gain was the metric used to find the best features 

 
   

results
model selection

for the male models bagging performed the best with
       accuracy and an auc of        but logistic
regression was ultimately chosen since it performed
better on the smaller feature set  logistic regression
was also chosen for the female model since it had
the highest accuracy and auc  the accuracy was
        and the auc was         tables

the top ten features are displayed in tables   and  
for males and females respectively  the bolded features are the one chosen for the final model  the
accuracy was calculated with the top ten features 
then  the lowest ranking feature was dropped  and
the accuracy was calculated again  this was repeated until only one feature was left  the feature
set with the highest accuracy was chosen  the male
model performed with        accuracy with only  
biomarkers  while the female model performed with
       accuracy with   biomarkers  the male model
