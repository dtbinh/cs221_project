introduction

laryngeal cancer is one of the most common types of head and neck cancer  depending on the stage of the
tumor  chemotherapy  partial laryngectomy  or total laryngectomy may be required  accurate staging of the tumor
is necessary to properly treat laryngeal cancer and avoid unnecessary procedures such as total laryngectomy  which
can significantly degrade a patients quality of life     
accurate staging of laryngeal cancer can be clinically challenging due to the difficulty of detecting the extent
of laryngeal cartilage invasion by the tumor  to resolve this limitation  high resolution magnetic resonance
imaging  mri  of the larynx     has been investigated and has led to the availability of high resolution  d mri
datasets with multiple contrasts  these datasets are well suited for automatic image segmentation of the larynx  i e  
classification of physiological structures and tissues   while fully automated segmentation of the laryngeal
cartilages remains unexplored  a multi contrast and multi dimensional approach has proven useful for segmenting
articular cartilage     
the purpose of this project was to investigate the application of
learning algorithms to automatically segment high resolution mr images
of the larynx  which can potentially increase the accuracy of laryngeal
cancer staging 

  

methods

in this project  we applied learning algorithms to implement
automatic segmentation of mr images of the larynx  among the various
tissues in the larynx  our focus was on the laryngeal cartilage  using the
different t  and t  relaxation times of cartilage versus surrounding
tissues  we selected appropriate mr sequences that produced images with
different contrast levels      each pixel in the resulting dataset was
represented as a vector of different intensity levels  figure   illustrates
the different contrast levels produced by the four different mr sequences
that were used to image the larynx of healthy volunteers  both a
supervised learning algorithm  support vector machine  svm  and an
unsupervised learning algorithm  k means  were investigated  for both
algorithms  the vector valued pixel intensities were used as features  for
the svm  a subset of larynx images was manually segmented for training
and quantitative assessment of testing accuracy  the segmentation
classes consisted of     ossified laryngeal cartilage and fat     muscle  and
   trachea and background pixels  these regions are denoted with arrows
in fig

a larynx dataset  four mr sequences
were chosen to yield different levels of

data acquisition
a larynx dedicated three channel array coil     was used to scan
two healthy volunteers on a ge     t mri system  four  d mr
sequences  proton density weighted spin echo  pd   spin echo  se   fast
spin echo ideal  fse ideal   and fast spin echo xl  fse xl   were
run to acquire four sets of images  these sequences were chosen based
on their ability to provide different contrast among cartilage  muscle  and
other tissues of interest 
    

procedure
a series of matlab routines was implemented to perform various
preprocessing steps to align images  registration   correct for the mr coil
sensitivity pattern  intensity correction   and structure the data into a

fiformat suitable for svm and k means  for the svm  we used the libsvm package     to implement a multi class
svm model  for k means  we directly implemented the algorithm in matlab  we tested the performance of both
algorithms on two larynx mr datasets  a detailed description of the procedure is given below 
       preprocessing
         registration
image registration was used for spatial alignment of images to correct for subject motion that may have
occurred between scan sequences  registration was performed automatically using mrvista  a matlab interface for
analyzing functional and anatomical data     
         intensity correction
since a larynx dedicated array was used to acquire the mr datasets  image intensity varied significantly
with spatial location relative to the array  intensity correction was performed to account for the coil sensitivity
profile that made regions near the array undesirably bright      we implemented an intensity correction method that
fit a low order polynomial to the proton density images  which represent the coil sensitivity      amplitude
thresholding was used to mask background and low snr regions of the image  and polynomial coefficients were
computed by solving the following convex optimization problem

min 

w  xa  y 

 
 

   

subject to xa    
where w is the diagonal matrix of binary mask weights  x is the regressor matrix containing powers and cross terms
of x and y coordinates up to the desired fitting order  y is the vector of original image values  and a is the vector of

polynomial coefficients 
       classification
         svm
manual image segmentation was done
using  dslicer  an insight segmentation and
registration toolkit  itk  based software     
pixels were manually labeled as one of three
classes 
   ossified laryngeal cartilage and fat
   muscle
   trachea and background
for training datasets  only regions that could be
labeled with high confidence were used  for
testing datasets  all pixels were labeled  as the
manual segmentation was used for quantitative
assessment of testing accuracy  subcutaneous fat
and ossified laryngeal cartilage  fatty marrow 
were given the same label due to their similar
contrasts in all images  making them difficult to
distinguish in manual segmentation  likewise  the
trachea and background were given the same label
since these regions do not produce an mr signal 
in each dataset  the mr slices covering the
laryngeal cartilages were chosen for processing 
datasets from two different subjects were used for
svm training and testing  libsvm     was used
to implement and solve the multi class svm  a
gaussian kernel was selected for the svm model

fithe svm performance was assessed by comparing the svm
classification with the manually segmented test data  an accuracy score
was computed as the ratio of correctly classified pixels to total pixels in
the region of interest 
         k means
the k means clustering algorithm was carried out on the same
datasets used for svm testing  the algorithm was run with k   clusters 
which allowed direct comparison with the manually segmented testing
images and svm results  the algorithm was repeated four times  and the
solution with the lowest objective value was used to avoid bad local
minima

intensity correction
figure   shows one slice from the testing dataset before and after
intensity correction  the third order polynomial fit to the original image
resulted in good intensity correction in a computation time of less than   
seconds on a     ghz intel core   duo processor  intensity correction
significantly improved the performance of both svm and k means
classification  figure   shows an example of the performance of svm
and k means with and without intensity correction  in both cases  the
quality of the resulting segmentation was greatly improved by intensity
correction  specifically  intensity correction improved the overall
accuracy of the svm by     the percentage of correctly labeled laryngeal
cartilage pixels by     and the percentage of correctly labeled muscle
pixels by     confusion matrices for the svm results are given in
tables   and   
svm
figure   shows the scatter plot of all pixels in the testing dataset 
with three of the four contrast levels plotted on the x  y  and z axes  the
label of each pixel was determined by manual segmentation  each
species forms a well localized cluster  suggesting that automatic
segmentation will yield good accuracy  figure   shows three slices from
the testing dataset  the top row shows one of the four contrasts  the
second row shows the manual segmentation  and the third row shows the
svm classification  for the svm  training and testing datasets were
acquired from larynx scans of two different subjects  the svm achieved
an overall accuracy of      since there were a disproportionate number
of background and muscle pixels compared to cartilage pixels  the
confusion matrix was computed to give a more detailed performance
metric  the confusion matrix is given in table    for comparison with
multi subject training and testing  an svm was trained and tested on
different slices from the same subject  the overall accuracy was     
and the confusion matrix is given in table    as expected  the accuracy
of single subject training and testing was better than that of multi subject
training and testing  the largest change in accuracy came from the
cartilage pixels  with an increase of     from     to       although
multi subject training and testing had a lower accuracy than singlesubject training and testing  the results were quite promising considering
the physiological differences among subjects  such as the degree of
ossification of laryngeal cartilage  which significantly affects the intensity
level of the signal  these differences can potentially be accounted for

fiusing additional preprocessing methods such as histogram
equalization 
a gaussian kernel with parameter g           
was used in the svm  which is the default kernel used by
libsvm  we also tested other built in kernels supported
by libsvm  including linear  polynomial  and sigmoid
kernels  there were no significant differences between the
gaussian and linear kernels  and the overall accuracy 
confusion matrices  and svm segmentations were very
similar for these kernels  for the polynomial and sigmoid
kernels  the performance was similar or worse than that of
the gaussian kernel among the range of parameters we
tested 
one drawback of using a supervised learning
algorithm for this application is that the manual
segmentation of training data can be very time consuming 
furthermore  manual segmentation is prone to errors  for
example  the thin layer of subcutaneous fat can be
especially challenging to manually segment due to its
irregular thickness and non contiguous structure  because
of these challenges  an unsupervised learning algorithm  kmeans  was investigated since it requires no manual
segmentation of images 
k means
the results of k means are shown in the last row of
figure    k means produced comparable segmentation
results as the svm without requiring manual segmentation 
since k means assigns class labels randomly  we manually
assigned each of the three output classifications to the
appropriate class  laryngeal cartilage fat  muscle  or
trachea background   by defining each output class in this
way and using the manually segmented testing images as
the gold standard for accuracy  we can compute an
accuracy score and confusion matrix for k means  allowing
us to quantitatively compare its performance to the svm 
the overall accuracy of k means was     with respect to
the manually segmented testing images  the confusion
matrix is shown in table    the k means confusion matrix
was almost identical to that of the single subject svm  i e  
training and testing data from one subject  shown in table
   when compared to the confusion matrix for the multisubject svm  table     the accuracy of the laryngeal
cartilage classification improved by     from     for the
svm to     for k means

mr sequence selection
each mr sequence we acquired had a scan time
ranging from two to ten minutes  due to practical limits on
the total duration of the mr exam as well as the increased
potential for motion  both during and between scans  from
long scan times  we would like to use the fewest number of
contrasts that still yields favorable accuracy  since this
requires the least amount of scan time  we investigated the
effects of using only a subset of the four contrasts  since
the proton density sequence was required for intensity

ficorrection  this resulted in three possible contrast pairs
when only two contrasts were used for svm training and
testing 
among those pairs  we found that the
combination of pd and se sequences resulted in the
most accurate segmentation  figure   shows the
segmentation results when each pair is used for svm
training and testing  qualitative assessment of the
segmented images shows that the pd and se sequence
pair results in the best segmentation of laryngeal
cartilage 
furthermore  quantitative comparison of
confusion matrices shows that the accuracy of laryngeal
cartilage classification is highest for this pair of
sequences            and     for pd se  pd fseideal  and pd fse xl  respectively  



figure    comparison of svm performance using
only two contrasts for svm training and testing 
we have successfully implemented svm and kresults demonstrate improved classification when
means algorithms to segment the cartilages from mr
the pd and se sequences are used  top row  
images of the larynx  an intensity correction technique
was implemented  resulting in significant improvements
in the performance of segmentation  svm classification
using multi subject training and testing achieved an overall accuracy of      muscle classification accuracy of     
laryngeal cartilage classification accuracy of      and trachea and background accuracy of     with respect to
manual segmentation  unsupervised k means produced comparable segmentation results without the need for
manual segmentation  which can be tedious and error prone 
for the svm  future work includes the investigation of specialized kernels derived from mr physics  which
can lead to better classification of the different species based on mr parameters such as t  and t  relaxation times 
for k means  future work includes comparison with other unsupervised learning algorithms  such as expectationmaximization  em   additional work includes the extension of this project to reconstruct an entire  d larynx
dataset  which can potentially increase the accuracy of laryngeal cancer staging
