introduction

figure    pressure and flow rate signals from subsurface in a conventional well test 

well testing is a crucial stage in the decision of
setting up new wells on oil field  decision makers
rely on the metrics to evaluate the candidate wells
potential  one important metric is permeability 
measuring the ability of porous material to transmit fluids  high permeability often leads to high
yielding 
in a conventional well test  the well is controlled
to produce at a constant flow rate  and the pressure is measured for a couple of hours  figure    
this pressure curve will be used to interpret the
reservoir parameters  including the permeability k
and initial pressure pi   to interpret the pressure
curve  a radial flow with infinite boundary model is
utilized  whose mathematical solution may be simply written in the equation    key parameters in
equation   are  pwf   the measured bottom hole
pressure  pi   the initial pressure  q  the constant
flow rate  k  the reservoir permeability  traditionally the permeability may be interpreted by comparing the observed pressure curve with the calculated overlay template  figure

noisy data are used to train a machine learning
model  which gives a good prediction given any flow
rate history  upon the completion of this step  the
reservoir parameters  which are the goal of the well
test  are actually stored in the machine learning
model  secondly  we try to interpret the well test
result by extracting the reservoir parameters from
the learning model  two difficulties lie in the process  first  the current physical model is designed
for constant flow rate  which is not the case in a
modern well test  second  while in traditional well
test the flow rate is accurate  in our problem both
the flow rate and pressure are noisy 
section   first discusses learning the data set by
locally weighted projection regression  lwpr

likelihood method in a hilbert space by defining a

nowadays  newly introduced permanent downhole gauge  pdg   is widely used  pdg can measure both the pressure and varied flow rate for a
long duration  figure     however  current well
test remains the conventional approach  interpreting only on a piece of pressure curve corresponding
to a constant flow rate  obviously  this method
wastes most data and the resulting interpretation
is not convincing 
this study tries to use machine learning approach to develop a method that is able to make
an interpretation on a modern well test by taking all measurements into account  we would like
to proceed in two steps  first  all the measured

locally weighted projection regression algorithm

 
 
 

locally weighted projection regression  lwpr 
is an algorithm that achieves nonlinear function
approximation in high dimensional spaces with locally weighted linear regression in each dimension
 atkeson  moore    schaal         the lwpr
algorithm is improved over the locally weighted
regression  lwr  algorithm by use of a projection
process 
the workflow of lwpr is as following     
project the training data into higher dimensional
spaces  a subset projected on each projection direction will be obtained      solve a lwr system
on each subset  a linear hypothesis will be trained
on each projection direction      sum up all hypothesis on all dimensions to reconstruct the hypothesis in the original one dimensional space

currently we suspect this suffers from two reasons  first is the relatively slow learning rate of the
algorithm  second is that the pressure is a result of
convolution of previous flow rates  horne        
as described in equation    to solve this problem 
one choice is to convert the data set into a space
where the pressures are independent of each other 
there actually is such a space where the pressures
are deconvolved  namely the laplace space 

lwpr in real time space

first the lwpr algorithm was applied to a
synthetic pressure generated from constant flow
rate without noise  in cases with constant flow
rates figure         lwpr works very well 
when the flow rate is not constant  the pressure transient is no longer increasing or decreasing
monotonically  the incorrect predictions will be
more prevalent figure     the lwpr algorithm
fails when the flow rate changes quickly  figure    

   

lwpr in laplace space

to apply the machine learning algorithm in laplace
space  the workflow is natural and straight forward 
    transform the data set into laplace space numerically      apply the machine learning method
 lwpr  in laplace space  obtain the prediction

in laplace space      invert the prediction numerically from laplace space back into time space  figure   shows the result in laplace space  from the
figure  it is clear that the method works well in
laplace space 
the prediction in the laplace space was then
converted into real time space  as shown in figure    the overall trend is captured well  two
zoom in views are also provided in figure    and
figure    
although the lwpr regression obtains good
prediction in the laplace space  the performance
is slow  there is heavy computation in the process
of transforming and inverting the data between the
real time space and the laplace time space  which
cost more than     cpu time  therefore  a rollback is required  how can we train the machine
learning algorithm in the real time space but void
the problem of data dependency  section   will
proposes another learning algorithm to answer this

question 

 
   

maximize likelihood
hilbert space

in

super position

first we need to understand the physical essence
of the pressure transient when the flow rates are
varied  when the flow rates are varied  the pressure transients are formed by a physical process
named super position  the pressure transients
caused by varied flow rates are actually a combination of multiple pressure transients each of which
is corresponding to a constant flow rate  figure   
demonstrates this process 
the super position enables us to re write the control equation of the pressure transient in a modern
well test  as shown in equation   
 

fiequation   may be written as


 i 
pwf   t  x i

so instead of feeding the learning algorithm
h  x    t x with data x i    we will feed the with
vector  x i    in this selected hilbert space  the
learning hypothesis becomes



 
   
  t  x i 
h  x i 

   

   

   
  

  

  

  
  
  
time samples 

  

  

so to train the learning algorithm  we just
need to estimate  by stochastic gradient descent
method  after the hypothesis  is obtained  we may
give a pressure transient prediction with any given
flow rate history by equation    besides accurate
prediction  we would also like to interpret the reservoir parameters like pi and k  it is actually very
straight forward after  is obtained  comparing
with equation    we can get

after
 training the learning hypothesis with all
 x i    the reservoir parameters obtained are
listed in table    the results are very close to the
true values of the reservoir parameters  figure     
the trend of the prediction is very good  but the
curve is oscillating because the flow rate history is
noisy  section     improves the training process by
imposing a pre processing on the noisy flow rates

smooth flow rate by edge preserving filter

we would like to smooth the flow rate  because the
prediction would be corrupted by the noise in flow
rate  however  simple smoothing techniques can
blur the edges at transition positions  and introduce error in all the data that follows  as a result 
we come up with the idea to use edge preserving
 

fifilters widely used in computer vision community 
specifically  we choose to use bi lateral filter  which
in essence is described by

the weight of data x to xi combines both magnitude and spatial differences  in contrast to normal
filters taking into account only spatial information 
by smoothing the flow rate with edge preserving
filter first and then applying the machine learning
algorithm discussed in section      the results are
much better  shown in figure    and table

summary

pressure  psi 

in this work  we first tried lwpr in real time and
laplace space to learn the underlying model of welltesting data  the prohibitive computation cost
lead us to re consider the problem  and come up
with the idea to apply superposition to re organize
the data and put them into a unified linear model 
based on this model  gradient descent is used to
learn the model parameters  which reveals the desired physical metrics of the well  finally we utilize edge preserving filter to smooth flow rate and
achieve further improved accuracy
