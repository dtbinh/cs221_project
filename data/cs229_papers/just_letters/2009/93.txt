readings that directly map to  x y z  locations within a  m  cube centered at each synapse  these readings were
provided for a total of    different proteins for every
single synapse 

motivation

many human neurological and cognitive disorders are
caused in part by aberrancies in the composition and
volume densities of synapses in the brain      the ability
to analyze the underlying causes of such diseases would
be greatly enhanced by detailed knowledge about the
ratio and quantities of different types of synapses that are
present in specific regions of a patients brain  in order to
make this possible  neuroscientists at stanford and
elsewhere are working towards developing methods to
accurately locate and classify individual synapses within a
sample of brain tissue      although many advances have
been made in this area of research  synapse classification
still requires biologists to manually analyze each synapse
in order to evaluate its type  here we propose a
computational approach to synapse classification based on
spatial protein data  not only would the success of this
method this greatly increase the efficiency of labeling
synapses by type  it could also help to elucidate novel
types of synapses that remain undiscovered as of yet 

 

 

in order to be useful for type classification  our model
needed to incorporate the distinguishing characteristics
of each of the three different categories of synapse   one
such characteristic is the relative amounts of different
proteins that are present in the region around a synapse 
we also hypothesized that the shape and size of a
synapse  including the relative locations of the regions
within the synapse where each protein is most highly
concentrated  would be important indicators of its type 
based on these traits  we came up with two different
models to test 

    baseline model

the first model  which we called our baseline model 
represents synapses of a given type as a multinomial
distribution over each of the n proteins in the dataset 
the values of the parameters of this multinomial
represent the likelihood of encountering one unit of a
particular type of protein in a narrow region around the
synapse  if x is a particular unit of protein density  and y
is the type of the synapse in question  then we have

overview

our goal was to use spatial information  location and
density  for multiple distinct proteins within a section of
brain tissue to classify potential synapses into one of
three categories  excitatory synapses  inhibitory synapses 
or non synapses  in order to develop an effective
solution to this problem  we aimed to answer the two
following questions 
    how can we develop a model that represents a
synapse accurately enough to enable us to infer
its type   and
    which among the proteins from our dataset
provide the most valuable information for
classifying synapses and what does this imply
about their biological function 

 

models

p x   y   multinomial  y         yn   
where  yi is the likelihood that unit x originates from
protein i given that the synapse is of type y  thus  a
particular synapse is modeled by the relative quantities of
the n proteins that it contains  this model only
incorporates the first of the characteristics in which we
are interested  but it has the advantage of simplicity 

    complex model

the next model strives to capture the characteristic
shape and size of each type of synapse  in order to
accomplish this  we decided to represent each synapse by
a multivariate gaussian that models its physical location
and shape in either   d or   d space  we tried both   we

data

we obtained data from the smith laboratory in the
department of molecular and cellular physiology at
stanford  the dataset consists of     labeled examples 
each of which is either an excitatory synapse  an
inhibitory synapse  or not a synapse  the information
given for each synapse is a series of protein density

here we refer to a non synapse as a category of synapse even
though it technically is not a synapse at all 
 

 

fidecided to experiment with three different variations of
this idea 
   model each synapse as a single gaussian 
   model each synapse as a composition of n distinct
gaussians  one for each protein 
   model each synapse as a composition of two
distinct gaussians  one representing the presynaptic region and the other representing the
postsynaptic region 
the motivation for these three slightly different models
came from thinking about the physical structure of a
synapse  the most basic variant views each synapse as a
single concentrated blotch of protein and models a
synapse of a given type as a gaussian over the location of
each unit of protein density  so that we have

 

methodology

multinomial logisitic regression and multinomial
gaussian discriminant analysis  gda  were used to fit
and test our various models  because of our small data
set size  we used leave one out cross validation  loocv 
to estimate the generalization error of our models 

    logistic regression   feature selection

we began by using logistic regression to compare our
baseline and complex models  in order to test our
baseline model  we calculated the normalized protein
distribution of each synapse in our data set and trained
our logistic regression classifier on these n features  one
for each protein  
we next wanted to determine which aspects of our
complex models contributed the most useful information
to the classifier  to do this  we first applied each of the
three models to every individual synapse in order to learn
a set of parameters for that synapse  from these
parameters  we extracted five representative features that
we hypothesized would be valuable in classifying the
synapses into types 
   variance of the locations of proteins weighted by
density  averaged across all dimensions of the data
 e g  in   d  we take the average of var x  and
var y    for each of the    proteins  n features    per
protein   this is intended to be a measure of how
diffuse each protein is within the synaptic region 
   variance of the mean locations of each protein  e g 
var       n  where i   mean location of protein i
weighted by density at each location     feature  
   variance of the locations of presynaptic proteins
and variance of the locations of postsynaptic
proteins  both weighted by density and averaged
across all dimensions of the data 
this is
analogous to feature   but for the pre  and postsynaptic regions    features  
   variance of the mean locations of the presynaptic
proteins and variance of the mean locations of the
postsynaptic proteins    features  
   difference from the average distance between the
presynaptic mean and the postsynaptic mean  e g 
compared to the average  how far is this synapses
presynaptic mean from its postsynaptic mean     
feature  
the first two features model the synapse as a
composition of n proteins  while the last three features
model the synapse as a composition of presynaptic and
postsynaptic regions 


p x   y   normal   y    y  

where p x y  is the total likelihood of all protein readings
from synapse x given that the synapse is of type y  here
we assume that protein readings are independent when
conditioned on y   the next variant models each protein
blotch from a distinct source as a separate gaussian  as
shown in figure   a   the third variant is based on a
slightly more sophisticated understanding of synapse
structure  in reality  a synapse is not just one or several
blotches of protein  instead  it is composed of a
presynaptic region and a postsynaptic region that are
responsible for carrying out different functions  because
of this  different proteins localize to each region  which
allows us to distinguish one from the other in our data 
we based the third variation of our model  shown in
figure   b   on this inherent biological synapse structure

bassoon  synapsin  the postsynaptic image is made up of the
cumulative densities of   postsynaptic proteins  gephyrin  psd 
notice that the presynaptic and postsynaptic regions are
slightly offset 

we ran logistic regression using each of these features in
conjunction with the baseline feature  normalized protein
distribution  and compared the results 
we also

 

fiperformed each test using both   d features  i e  features
extracted along a fixed z plane  and   d features to
compare the information gained in three dimensions 

we used three dimensional data for all three
implementations and restricted our analysis to using the
five proteins gad  bassoon  synapsin  gephyrin  and psd  the
first three of which are presynaptic proteins  and the last
two of which are postsynaptic proteins   we obtained
the best results using model    which maintains a
separate representation for the regions of density of each
protein  rather than massing them together  figure    
however  neither of the three achieved a particularly
high accuracy 

we found that many of the above features contributed
little or nothing to the accuracy of the classifier  the
feature that helped the most was the measure of how
diffuse each protein is within the synaptic region  feature
    in addition  we discovered that models that used   d
features consistently matched or outperformed models
that were based on   d data  finally  we found that
using smaller regions to extract features significantly
improved the accuracy of our model  figure    

figure    accuracy of multinomial gda classifier using each
of the three complex models  model    which represents each
protein separately  was the most successful

using each of the six   d features and   d features in
conjunction with protein distribution alone  feature    the
measure of how diffuse each protein is  contributed the most
accuracy out of all the features  additionally  we see from
column   that  d features extracted from a small region  a
 x x  pixel area  provided more accuracy than the large
region    x  x   pixels  

results

our most successful classification was realized using
logistic regression operating on the baseline protein
distribution along with feature set    measures of how
diffuse each protein is  in three dimensions  our model
yielded     accuracy with an roc auc of      for nonsynapse synapse classification and      for excitatory
 inhibitory synapse classification  in comparison  logistic
regression operating only on the baseline model of   d
protein distribution yields     accuracy with an roc
auc of      for non synapse synapse classification and
     for excitatory inhibitory synapse classification

    gaussian discriminant analysis  gda 

to further explore our complex models  we implemented
a gda algorithm to fit parameters to our data for each of
the three models 
model    we fit a single multivariate gaussian to
each of the three types of synapses 
model    we modeled a separate gaussian over
each protein to characterize each synapse type by
a set of n gaussians 
model    finally  we learnt a presynaptic
gaussian and a postsynaptic gaussian for each
synapse type 
after learning each model  we classified new synapses by
calculating p x y   the probability that synapse x was
generated by the gaussian model s  with parameters
y       y d and y       y d  where d     for model    d   n
for model    d     for model    and p y   the probability
of encountering a synapse of type y  we calculated
p x y p y  for every y and selected the type category
with highest probability

secondly  our gda classifier was most successful when
using a model that represented the density units from
each protein as a separate gaussian distribution 

biological relevance

though we began with feature information for   
proteins  this was far too much information to train on
with only     data points  using forward search  we
determined a subset of four proteins that yielded maximal
accuracy  bassoon  synapsin  gad  and psd  we trained and
tested our model using each protein alone to infer the
relative importance of each protein  figure     synapsin
was found to be the best at distinguishing between nonsynapses and synapses and gad was the most useful for
distinguishing between excitatory and inhibitory
synapses  these results agree with the currently known
functions of these proteins  synapsin is thought to be
present in every synapse  which explains its strong
performance in distinguishing between synapses and
non synapses  and gad is known to be a good marker of
inhibitory synapses       

in general  our gda classifier was less successful than
our logistic regression classifier  we believe that the
principal reason for the discrepancy between the two is
that our gda model did not explicitly include a
representation of the relative amounts of each protein
present within each type of synapse  which has proven to
be a very powerful feature  however  it is interesting to
note that gda using complex model   was still quite
successful even without this feature 
although we tested many features in our logistic
regression classifier  only a few actually contributed to
improving our accuracy  one model in particular that
seemed to be of little worth is the pre  post  synaptic
region model  the features extracted from this model
did not help with logistic regression  nor did it produce
good results when used as a basis for gda  one possible
reason for this is that the pre  post  synaptic regions are
not well represented within the data  the resolution may
actually be too low to capture a clear relationship
between the two regions 
there were many other complicating factors that made it
difficult to extract useful features and construct an
accurate synapse model  for example  it is possible that
some of the labeled regions we were working with
actually contained multiple synapses of different classes 
these mixed signals certainly contributed to our inability
to achieve above a maximum of     accuracy

discussion

finally  we were constricted by the fact that we had very
few training examples to work with  we only had a total
of     labeled synapses  furthermore  within this set 
less than     of our examples were non synapses  which
could explain why our ability to distinguish synapses
from non synapses is much poorer than our ability to
distinguish excitatory synapses from inhibitory ones 

our results show that the protein distribution at a
synapse is by far the best predictive characteristic of the
data that we have for synapse type  this result is
unsurprising because it is based in biological fact 
proteins have very specific biologic functions and localize
to specific synapse types  here  we also explored other
features of the data that would enrich our synapse model
and improve our classification accuracy  we attempted
to represent the shape and size of synapses in a variety of
ways  we included certain shape size features as input
to our logistic regression classifier  and we also
implemented a multiclass gda algorithm that modeled
each class  i e  each synapse type  as a different gaussian
or set of gaussians  although not all of these approaches
were successful  our results clearly demonstrate that the
shape and size of a synapse are relevant to its type  we
have two results that lead us to this conclusion  first  we
saw that when we added a measure of how diffuse each
protein is at the synapse as an input feature to our
logistic regression classifier  our accuracy improved

classifier trained on our complex model 

another consequence of our small dataset was that our
classifier has fairly high variance  indicated by the fact

 

fithat the test error is much higher than the training error
 see learning curve plotted in figure     however  we
believe that this could be easily fixed with a larger
training set size 

account and is able to adjust for the possibility that the
data is not      accurate 
another source of complexity is the potential for
synapses to overlap within the brain  currently  the
model we use would inherently interpret two overlapping
synapses as a single entity  which again leads to a
misrepresentation of the data  a model and inference
strategy that could account for this situation as well
would be all the more powerful 

it is worth noting that labeling of synapses by hand is a
difficult problem in itself and has a fairly high error rate 
therefore  our     accuracy rate may or may not reflect
biological truth  ideally  a computational approach such
as the one proposed here could be used in conjunction to
elucidate biology  for example  synapses that get labeled
as non synapses by a computational method are ideal
candidates to be reexamined by a neuroscientist to
determine whether they were incorrectly labeled or
perhaps belong to a novel type of synapse that does not
fall into either the excitatory or inhibitory category 

 

another exciting direction in which to take this project in
the future would be an attempt to apply an unsupervised
learning algorithm to cluster synapses into different
types based on the features that weve found to be most
salient  this approach could move beyond distinguishing
between the three basic categories that weve discussed
 excitatory  inhibitory  non synapse  and potentially may
reveal new classes of synapses that might be biologically
significant 

future directions

the inability of any of our classifiers to surpass an
accuracy level of     may be due in large part to the
noise that exists in our data  none of the models we
propose account this noise  even though it almost
certainly impacts the features we use

one important source of error is the inaccuracy which
accrues from the wetlab techniques that are used to
generate our data  the spatial protein data we use is
collected using a technique called immunostaining 
whereby fluorescence markers are bound to proteins
present in the tissue  however  these markers are not
guaranteed to bind evenly across all proteins  which can
lead to a misrepresentation of the true underlying protein
densities  for example  it is possible that synapsin was
simply not detected at a particular location  which might
lead to that region to be inaccurately classified as a nonsynapse even though all other features indicate otherwise 
a possible extension to our project would be to modify
and extend our model so that it takes this noise into
