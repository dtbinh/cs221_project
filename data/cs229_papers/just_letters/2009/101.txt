introduction
antenna arrays are extremely useful in communication systems due to the flexibility and control
that they allow over the radiation pattern of the antenna  efficient and well directed radiation
patterns cause minimum interference and noise and are highly desirable  the simplest way to
control the radiation pattern is by using antenna arrays which are just periodic arrangements of
radiating elements since changing just the currents and the relative phase between the elements
of the array results in a large change in the shape of the pattern and the direction of the beam 
this is due to the so called array factor which quantifies the effect of combining radiating
elements in an array without the element specific radiation pattern taken into account  the
overall radiation pattern of an array is determined by this array factor combined with the
radiation pattern of the antenna element 
motivation
a common problem in antenna arrays is the failure of the elements due to wear and tear and
detection of the faulty elements is a difficult problem if the size of the antenna is large  the most
widely used techniques in the detection process are neural network algorithms        with radial
basis functions in the decision nodes  but the disadvantage of using neural networks is that they
require multiple layers and input nodes for training and these result in large amount of
computations and hence large training time  also the probability of ending up at a local minima
is also not negligible  we therefore propose to use svm based classification on this problem 
problem statement
the training data for this problem is presently generated by simulating the radiation pattern of an
   element linear array antenna  the radiation pattern is determined as a function of the distance
from the radiating elements and the samples of the radiated power at different points constitute
the training vectors  thus our features are the samples of the radiated power  the different
training vectors are generated by varying the current in the radiating elements and also the
position of the faulty elements  other parameters that can be varied are the separation between
the elements and the wavelength of the transmitted signals  to the training vectors we added
gaussian noise and also uniformly distributed noise to simulate real world data  we collected a
dataset of about      training vectors for the linear antenna case  each element in the antenna
array is numbered and the decision vectors simply indicate the failed elements indices 
this procedure was also applied to a planar antenna array which is just a   d version of the linear
antennas comprising of    antenna elements in a     grid  the training set here is composed of
measurements of radiation power as in the case of the linear array on a single plane  the decision
vectors indicate the x and y indices of the failed elements in the planar array

distorted pattern of a faulty antenna

the radiation pattern changes as faults are introduced in the array of antennas  noise is also
added to the system when measurements of the radiated power are made due to interference and
other factors  the above figure shows the degradation as the result of a single element of the
array failing  as more elements fail the pattern gets degraded further 
implementation of the training
libsvm was used for svm based classification and our initial training set consisted of      sets
of     training features each  the training vectors consisted of measured powers for different
signal to noise ratios  snr   a lower signal to noise ratio  less than   db  resulted in a very less
detection accuracy of around     while increasing the snr to more than    db increased the
accuracy to more than      as expected the accuracy improved with an increasing snr  a
similar pattern was also observed when tested with a planar array

fithe detection accuracy for both antennas remained constant as snr was increased beyond   
db  while the testing error that we observed decreased with an increased size of training set 
increasing it above      resulted in more errors  this could be because of over fitting and also
because our increased training set consisted of training vectors that had more noise in the
readings  these readings only distorted the data and also affected the accuracy of the classifier
resulting in the decreased accuracy

effect of increasing training size on detection accuracy 
we also implemented the svm classifier with different kernels  the polynomial  sigmoid 
linear and the radial basis  the performance for the different kernels was almost the same  only
the sigmoid kernel performed poorly and had very low detection accuracy 
redundancy of measured data 
the measured data from the antenna radiation patterns were vectors with     features 
the inherent symmetry of the radiation pattern resulted in some redundancy in the training
vectors  for this reason we used principal component analysis  to reduce the dimension of the
vectors  after performing pca  we observed that the dimension of the data could be reduced to
only   by taking only the most significant eigenvalues  thus a large reduction in data size could
be obtained

ficonclusions
over the course of the project we observed that svm was a very good tool to identify
faulty elements in an antenna array  thus it could be the ideal replacement for the neural network
based fault detection  we also observed that increasing the training examples  by adding training
sets  with the elements having different excitation current   led to better results and lower testing
error  but adding training sets with a high level of noise resulted in the accuracy dropping since
these vectors actually distorted the training decision 
future work
   the accuracy in predicting faulty elements for a planar array is not as good as that of the
linear array  the feature set and the different training sets necessary should be optimized
for better results 
   current work has taken into account only the radiation pattern  scattering pattern can also
be used to improve the performance of the predictor 
   the symmetry of the antenna array can be used to further optimize the performance of
the predictor
