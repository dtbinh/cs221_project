introduction

signatures are a popular means of authentication  they  ideally  are unique
to a person and  therefore  hard to copy  two common types of signatures
are traditional pen on paper signatures and electronic signatures  electronic signatures are done on a custom built electronic board using a stylus 
the electronic board records information such as pressure  acceleration  and
angle of the stylus in addition to the standard signature image  this information is used by a signature recognition system to differentiate authentic
signatures from fraudulent ones  both types of signatures have their drawbacks  while traditional pen on paper signatures are prone to forgery by
expert humans  electronic signatures require a special electronic board to
record the signature 
in this project  we design and implement a novel mechanism of authentication  called mobile virtual signature  using mobile phones  modern mobile
phones such as the apple iphone and the google g phone are equipped with
multiple sensors including accelerometers  orientation sensors  temperature
sensors  proximity sensors  and multi touch sensors  in our authentication
mechanism  a person authenticates by signing in the air with the phone 
the sensors on the phone  primarily the accelerometer and the orientation
sensor  continuously record various parameters such as position  acceleration
and angle  this information is then used by a machine learning program
running on the mobile phone to recognize the signature 
the authentication mechanism has several advantages  first  just like
the traditional signatures  mobile virtual signatures stay unique to each person and can be changed if necessary  second  it makes forgery hard as the
signature is made in the air and without producing any tangible output
 

fito copy from  third  it is hard to map the information collected by the
accelerometers back to the actual physical movement that produced the signature  finally  the mechanism uses popular mobile phones  and hence can
be deployed on a large scale without additional cost 
we have developed a prototype of the system on the google g phone 
the g phone runs the open source android operating system which allows
for easy development of new applications and reuse of components built by
other developers 

 

system design

we have implemented a java application on android to collect values from
accelerometer and orientation sensors as our training set and run an svmbased learning algorithm to classify authentic and non authentic signatures 
the values from the accelerometer sensor are defined in the accelerometer
reference      we record acceleration in the x  y and z axes  whose positive
directions are toward the right side  top  and front of the device respectively 
the values from the orientation sensor are defined in the orientation sensor reference      we record three values from the orientation sensor

 azimuth figure      the angle in current reference to magnetic north 
ranges between          
 pitch figure      the degree to which the device is tilted forwards or
backwards  ranges between             
 roll figure      the rotation of the device in relation to the bottom left
hand corner of the screen  ranges between           

 

fiusing this application  the user can create input samples and label them
as authentic or non authentic  the application logs each input sample
into a file  which is then used by the machine learning algorithm to train test
the authenticity of the input signature

she will be presented with a log button  the user then signs her signature
while holding the log button down  and then releases the button  after
the signature logging  the user is presented with   options 
 success   use the logged data as an authentic signature to train the
system 
 fail   use the logged data as an non authentic signature to train the
system 
 test   test the authenticity of the signature based on the training data

training and evaluation
test data

we generated about     signatures  including two of our group members
signatures  each of the two signed for about     times as positive training
data  and about     irrelevant patterns as negative training data 

   

feature extraction

for each signature  we log the output of the accelerometer and orientation
sensor and store them in increasing time order based on timestamp  we then
divide the log data evenly into s segments  for s                      for each
segment  compute the mean of accelerometer readings   in x  y  z directions 
respectively  and orientation sensor  in aziroth  pitch  roll  respectively   we
then use these six mean values as features for that particular data segment 
thus  we have    s features for each signature 

   

training

we use svm with linear kernel and l  soft margin  our svm is implemented using cvx  a convex optimization problem solver built on matlab  http   www stanford edu  boyd cvx    we use c       for the l 
soft margin  we use a very large c here so that the alpha values will not be
affected by l  soft margin constraint in most cases 

   

evaluation

  our first attempt was to use leave one out cross validation  as it took
too much time to train and evaluate on every single test data  we also tried
k fold cross validation for k      on larger data sets 

   

experimental results

in table   and    we show our experimental result for two different evaluations  leave one out and    fold cross validation  as we increate the
number of segmentation  the error rate also decreases as the number of features increases as well  however  if we have too many segmentations  the

error rate would instead increase  for example the error rate for    segmentations in table   is higher than that of    segmentations  this is because
two little data points inside each segmentation  and since the reading of sensors are prone to the affect of noise  if we have too many segmentations  the
features are affected by noise more 

 

related work

our authentication mechanism falls in the category of online signature recognition  previous work on online signature recognition     uses position x  y  
pressure  and orientation of the stylus on the electronic board as the input
features  the system stores preprocessed genuine signatures captured from
each user  it then uses dynamic time warping and hmm models to compute the similarity between the new input signature and the stored genuine
signatures 
movisign differs from the previous work in terms of both the feature set
and the classification mechanism  movisign uses   d position  and orientation based on signatures generated by hand gestures using mobile devices 
it then uses supervised machine learning algorithm to classify signatures as
aunthentic and fake ones

conclusion

mobile virtual signature is a novel and potentially useful application of mobile
phones  in this project  we designed and implemented the system using a
simple svm based machine learning algorithm  our results show that the
algorithm does a good job of classifying signatures  with very low error rates
