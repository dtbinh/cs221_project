stock forecasting
using hidden markov processes
joohyung lee  minyong shin

   introduction
in finance and economics  time series is usually modeled as a geometric brownian motion with drift 
especially  in financial engineering field  the stock model  which is also modeled as geometric
brownian motion  is widely used for modeling derivatives  in this model  the stock return is modeled
as a brownian motion with draft 

s t     s t
  rt   t   z t      t     t

here the coefficient of the drift   and volatility   are constant here  this model reflects the
distribution of the actual data indeed  as we can see the figure  below  the overall data distribution
follows

figure   weekly stock return s p     from    mar      
however  if we are in bear market which is the times such as internet bubble or recent economic
recession or bull market in which we can observe obvious economic growth  it is difficult to discern
we are in which situation  also  in those times  the mean and variance of the stock will be totally
different  the following figure   shows this 
we define these region of time as a regime whose mean and variance are explicitly different from other
region of time  this regime can represent economic situation  if we can figure out this regime  in other
words  current economic situation  we can forecast better than using constant mean and variance  in
this project  we would like to construct this regime and utilize it for the stock forecasting using one of
the machine learning algorithms 
for this  we model the stock series has gaussian distribution in a regime and each regime is modeled
hidden markov model  hmm  to obtain the discrete economic situations  in this model  each
economics states is changing by a transition matrix which we need to estimates  thus  we extract

fieconomic situations from the stock data itself 
as an extended model  we used another economic data for estimating economic change  this data can
be the market information data such as volatility index or macro economic data such as gdp  in this
project  we used default data for this

figure    stock return  s p     in bear market and bull market
in figure    we can observe the obvious increase of number of defaults in the bear market and the
small and stable number of defaults in bull market  using this data  we discretize the economic
situation and vary the transition for mean and variance states of stock 

s p    and default data from   mar

single hmm

as we briefly introduced  we model the stock return series as a mixture of gaussian distribution
and discrete markov chain  in a certain regime  stock series follow geometric brownian motion
with drift  which means stock returns have gaussian distribution and the regimes are changing by
the discrete markov process 
for example  while  in good economic situation  stock return has higher mean and smaller
variance  it has lower mean and larger variance in bad economic situation  in this case  we have
two economic states  i e  good and bad  and each state has different mean and variance  the
regime changing occurs randomly in this model  however  the changing probability is fixed and
consistent thought the stock return series  we use a transition matrix for this

figure    single hidden markov model  the discrete markov chain represent economic situation
and each economic situation had different mean and variance of stock return 

     

double hmm

single hmm identifies the economic situation and the mean and variance states of stock return 
this implies any change of economic situation reflected on the stocks mean and variance
simultaneously  this is reasonable considering fast and very responsive market but with this
model there is no way to improve prediction  thus  for the purpose of predictability improvement 
we need to separate the economic situation from the mean and variance states so that the mean and
variance can follow the signal from the economic situation  by modeling like this  we expect any
economic situation changes prior to the mean and variance state change 
thus  in double hmm  we modeled the default event as mixture of poisson distribution with
discrete markov chain and use this model to indicate the change of economics  we assume in
every discrete economic situation  it has different poisson intensity and the number of defaults is
generated by the default intensity  we can obtain the economic situation without the stock return
data 
in each economic situation  it has different transition matrix for the mean and variance states  this
allows us to vary the probability from one state to another by the economic situations  which gives
us more degree of freedom to fit the data and  once the parameters are learned  its predictability
would be better

    method   em algorithm
since we modeled stock return and the number of defaults as the mixture of gaussian and discrete
markov chain and poisson and discrete markov chain respectively  the natural choice of method
should expectation and maximization algorithm  in this chapter  we present the detail of
derivation of the two models

we run separate em algorithm for default data and using that information to run em algorithm in
mean variance data  to avoid redundancy  this part does not contain any derivation steps but
include the key equation to implement the algorithm 
for default data  everything is similar with previous em algorithm except the probability of
resulted default number is poisson distribution  and the default intensity lambda is introduced as a

   simulation
    data and procedure
for stock data  we used weekly s p     price from    mar      from http   finance yahoo com
and for the default data  we used the weekly number of default data supplied from risk
management class  ms e      
we predict stock movements in bear market regime and bull market regime which are presented
in figure   with red line and light green line respective  those regimes correspond to from week
number      to      and week number      to       to forecast the stock return in the next
week  we used   years horizon  which is     weeks prior to the prediction week as a training set 
once  the parameters are set through the learning algorithm  we forecast the stock return by giving
the distribution of stock return of the next week 
we perform the simulation with   states and   states for both modes  thus  we simulated   states
and   states of single hmm  and   by   and   by   states of double hmm 
as a performance measure to compare two models  we used sum of logarithm of the probability
that the stock return is equal to the actual one given our predicted distribution 

    simulation result
in each simulated graph  the prediction distribution is presented as a surface and the actual stock
return is drawn as points 

fifigure    bear market prediction   upper row panels for single hmm and lower row
panels for double hmm
since the  d surface stands for the predicted probability distribution in figure    if the light blue
dots  the actual returns  sit on the higher hills of the surface  it means our prediction is good  this
performance measure calculated in each case 
as we can see in figure    double hmm performs better than the single hmm when the number
of states is the same  also    states case performs better than the case of   states  this is possible
because larger number of states is generating fine many states which cause higher peaks and this
leads poor predictability  in other words  fine states division can lead higher belief in small range
of return and this belief is usually wrong 
in the bull market  figure     we can observe similar pattern  obviously  the variance is much
smaller than that of bear market and also the measure is higher than the measure of bear market

figure    transition matrix of mean variance states for the three economic
states  the large value of lambda means bad situation economically 
in double hmm setting  transition matrix has changed as the default state lambda varying  above
figure shows the em learning value of transition matrix into image form  brighter section is
bigger value  as we see above  the transition matrix varies along the lambda  at the left upper plot 
lambda value is the smallest  which means economic situation is good  and every state in meanvariance of stock return are stable and there is almost no probability of state changing  so if
economic state is good  the state of mean variance stays in where it was  bigger lambda means the
economic situation is severe  as in left lower plot  the transition matrix shows there is probability
from good mean variance to worse mean variance  but no probability of getting better 
therefore  transition matrix behavior is intuitively correct and it supports our previous assumption
  transition probability of mean variance is varying along the default state  as well 

   conclusion and future works
in this project  we modeled the stock return as a mixture of gaussian and discrete markov chain in
order to improve the predictability of the stock model  also  we introduced another economic data to
present double hmm which runs the markov chain of the economic states separately  which gives
model more degree of freedom  as a result  we can verify that the double hmm can predict better
than the single hmm and its transition matrix verifies the effectiveness of double hmm 
as a future works  we can test the effectiveness of other economic data  in this project  we used default
data for the economic states  however  the volatility index data can be a good candidate to extract the
economic situation because it can gives us direct estimation of variance  as we mentioned in the
introduction  the macroeconomic data is also directly connected to the economic situation too  by
testing the effectiveness of those candidates  we can improve the predictability more  moreover  if we
can construct a choosing algorithm that chooses the most effective candidate by learning  we might
build efficient trading machine
