abstract  
    
for  our  project   we  analyze  data  from  us  congress  voting  records   a  dataset  that  consists  of   yes     no    or   not  present   votes  on  
various  bills  for  each  active  congressperson     by  scraping  and  parsing  this  data   we  are  able  to  model  a  congressperson  as  a  list  of  
bills  for  which  they  voted     after  doing  so   we  have  a  data  model  perfectly  suited  to  the   bag  of  words   model  from  information  
retrieval    an  unordered  set  of   terms    or  bills   instantiated  in  multiple   documents    congresspeople      we  use  several  
information  retrieval  techniques  on  this  dataset   focusing  on  the  use  of  latent  factor  models     these  models  assume  that  a  fixed  
number  of  latent   topics   are  responsible  for  creating  each  bill   and  that  congresspeople  themselves  can  be  represented  as  a  
mixture  of  these  topics  corresponding  to  the  topics  they  are  likely  to  vote  for     we  then  decompose  our  documents  and  bills  into  
topic  vectors   a  process  that  yielded  several  interesting  results     first   we  are  able  to  compute  the  document  similarity  between  
any  two  congresspeople   which  we  use  to  create  a   d  visualization  of  congress  in  which  the  distance  between  congresspeople  
represents  their  voting  record  dissimilarity     second   we  have  a  topic  representation  of  all  the  bills  in  congress   which  we  use  to  
cluster  and  visualize  legislation   to  perform  the  actual  dimensionality  reduction   we  use  research  lsi  techniques  such  as  the  
singular  value  decomposition   plsi   and  latent  dirichlet  allocation     we  used  lda  to  visualize  political  issues  viewed  as  topics   and  
to  gain  a  measure  of  bipartisanship  in  congress   our  dataset  is  readily  available  
from  http   www govtrack us congress votes xpd   
  
pre processing  and  setup  
    
for  our  project   we  use  the  data  available  at  http   clerk house gov evs      index asp     vote  information  for  each  bill  is  in  the  
convenient  xml  format   and  we  were  able  to  build  a  scraper  that  extracted  the  needed  information  for  our  data  analysis   we  
created  a  numerical  encoding  for  each  congressperson   ci   as  well  as  a  numerical  encoding  for  each  bill   bi      with  these  
encodings   we  produce  our  training  data  set  in  two  formats     the  first  format  is  a  mapping  from  bi  to  a  list  of   ci   vote  type    where  
vote  type  is  simply  yes   no   or  not  present   the  second  format  is  the  reverse  mapping  from  ci  to  a  list  of   bi   vote  type    
  
this  data  is  then  sent  to  a  python  script   which  prepares  our  extracted  information  for  lda   see  next  section   by  turning  it  into  a  
series  of   documents    with  each  document  as  a  congressperson  and  each  word  as  a  bill  that  they  voted  for   
    
low rank  approximation  of  
congresspeople  and  issues  
  
as  mentioned  before   one  of  the  goals  
of  the  project  is  to  create  a  simple  
visual  representation  of  
congresspeople     in  order  to  do  this   we  
need  to  reduce  the  matrix  m  to  three  
dimensions   where  each  row  of  m  
represents  a  bill   each  column  
represents  a  congressperson   and  the  
matrix  entry  represents  a  yes   no   or  
not  present  vote  on  the  bill     this  is  
accomplished  using  lsi  techniques  of  
svd  decomposition  and  low rank  
approximation   using  latent  semantic  
indexing   we  can  reduce  m  to  a  k rank  
matrix  m   and  m  is  a  product  of  three  
figure     
matrices  u s   and  v   m  has  the  property  
that  it  is  a  matrix  of  rank  k  with  the  
smallest  frobenius  error     
consequently   m  captures  the  orthogonal   and  thus   information  dense    axes  from  our  high dimensional  data     in  our  case   we  
produce  m  of  rank  three   and   using  s  and  v  matrices  from  the  svd  decomposition  of  m   we  can  represent  each  congressperson  
as  a  point  in  three  dimensional  space   where  each  dimension  corresponds  to  a  linear  combination  of  various  bills   or  topics      by  

fithe  johnson lindenstrauss  theorem   the  
distances  between  two  congresspeople  in  
this   d  space  should  be  a  reflection  of  their  
distance  in  the  much  higher  dimension  
space  of  congresspeople  x  bills     because  
the  nature  of  lsi  is  such  that  dimension  
reduction  combines   related   axes  in  vector  
space   in  our  graphs   congresspeople  with  
similar  opinions  on  various  issues  appear  
close  to  each  other   and  congresspeople  
with  differing  opinions  will  be  far  apart   
  
after  applying  the  above  methods  to  our  
data   we  were  able  to  generate  the  graph  in  
figure        in  the  graph   each  blue  data  point  
represents  one  democratic  congressperson   
and  each  red  point  represents  one  
figure     
republican  congressperson     the  latent  
semantic  analysis  technique  works  as  
predicted   in  the  figure   it  is  clear  that  
democratic  congresspeople  belong  to  one  clear  cluster   whereas  republican  congresspeople  are  in  the  other  clear  cluster     when  
analyzing  the  graph   we  saw  a  few  republican  congressmen  who  were  close  or  in  the  cluster  of  democrats     we  investigated  these  
curious  data  points  and  found  that  these  congresspeople  were  well  known  to  be  moderate  republicans  with  a  liberal  voting  
record     in  particular   in  figure      the  data  point  with  the  red  circle  around  it  represents  wayne  gilchrest   a  congressman  from  
maryland   who  according  to  wikipedia  is  commonly  known  to  be  a  republican in the name only  and   in  fact   was  ranked  as  the  
houses  most  liberal  republican  in      by  the  national  journal   wikipedia    
  
in  addition   our  graph  shows  a  much  tighter  cluster  of  democrats  than  republicans   perhaps  indicating  that  republicans  in  the  
house  were  more  ideologically  independent  than  democrats   who  tended  to  vote  as  a  more  cohesive  block  during  this  period   
  
since  the  results  of  applying  svd  and  low  rank  approximation  to  the  bill congressman  matrix  m  were  so  successful   our  next  
strategy  was  to  apply  svd  to  the  transpose  of  m     the  idea  is  to  now  reduce  every  bill  to  a  point  in  three   dimensional  space   and  
graph  the  resulting  points     the  results  are  plotted  in  figure        there  are  no  two  or  three  obvious  clusters  in  the  figure   and  the  
points  form  somewhat  of  a  continuous  surface     consequently   this  strategy  is  not  successful  in  finding  few   obvious  bill  clusters   
and  we  used  a  modification  of  the  above  technique  to  achieve  interesting  results

discovery  of  bill  issues  

fiin  order  to  find  a  small  number  of  bill  clusters   we  perform  a  low  rank  approximation  of  the  transpose  of  m   in  this  case   our  
approximation  is  of  rank  twenty five   which  we  determined  experimentally     consequently   every  bill  is  now  a  point  in  twenty five  
dimensional  space     once  we  have  this  representation   we  are  able  to  collect  the  top  bills  for  every  dimension     a  bill  is  
considered  a  top  bill  for  a  dimension  if  the  value  of  the  coordinate  of  the  bill  for  this  dimension  is  large   which  indicates  that  this  
dimension  had  a  significant  contribution  to  the  reconstruction  of  the  bill  in  our  higher  order  space   and  informally  that  the  latent  
topic  plays  a  large  role  in  the  perception  of  this  bill     upon  analysis  of  the  top  bills   in  almost  every  dimension   we  saw  that  top  
bills  corresponded  to  one  particular  issue     as  an  example   the  top  three  bills  for  four  out  of  twenty five  dimensions  are  shown  in  
table        each  group  is  labeled  with  the  real world  political  issue  that  the  dimension  represents   consequently   this  bill  clustering  
technique  is  successful  in  finding  bills  concerned  with  the  same  topic  using  unsupervised  learning     
  
a  latent  topic  approach  to  political  issue  discovery  
  
another  one  of  our  goals  for  this  project  was  to  develop  a  generative  topic  model  for  congress   and  analyze  the  implications  of  
such  a  model   where  the  topics  represent  political  issues  that  drive  politicians  votes     a  topic  in  this  model  is  simply  a  distribution  
over  votes   yes   no   not  present  on  bills   
we  designed  the  following  generative  topic  model  for  the  voting  record  of  a  congressperson     
  
   choose  n      number  of  bills   which  turns  out  to  be  irrelevant     
   choose     dirichlet    corresponding  to  the   congressperson  topic  multinomial    the  mixing  proportions  of  topics  for  c  
   for  each  vote  n    
a  choose  the  latent  topic  zn     mult            
b  vote  on  the  bill  b  with  vote  v      absent   yes   or  no   bv     p   bv     zn       which  is  a  multinomial  conditioned  on  the  
topic  zn           
  
essentially   if  a  congressperson  is  pro choice   then  they  have  a  high  probability  of  voting  yes  on  bills  that  are  also  
considered  pro choice     once  we  condition  on  the  topic  of  pro choice   the  congressperson  and  the  bill  become  conditionally  
independent     thus   we  draw  a  topic  out  of  a  congressperson s  topic  multinomial   draw  a  bill  out  of  that  topic s  distribution   and  
the  congressperson  votes  the  way  given  by  the  topic s  distribution  over  bill  votes     accordingly  a  pro choice  congressperson  c s  
multinomial  c    will  have  high  values  for  topics  z  whose  distribution  place  more  weight  on  yea  votes  on  pro choice  bills       
this  topic  model  is  an  exact  analogy  to  latent  dirichlet  allocation   lda    which  supposes  the  same  distribution  over  
documents  and  words        we  are  thus  able  to  model  a  congressperson  as  a  document  and  their  votes  on  bills  as  the  words  that  
comprise  the  document  representing  them     by  processing  this  data  with  lda   we  can  recover  the  probabilities  of  each  bill  given  a  
topic  as  well  as  the  congressperson  topic  multinomial  for  each  voting  member  of  the  u s   house  of  representatives     lda  is  a  
widely  studied  generative  model  of  corpora  and  we  were  able  to  take  advantage  of  existing  algorithms  for  finding  a  distribution  
for  each  of  the  k  topics  that  maximizes  the  likelihood  of  this  generative  model   we  used  the  gibbs  sampling  algorithm  presented  
in       that  finds  the  distribution  for  each  topic  that  maximizes  the  likelihood  of  this  generative  model     the  markov  chain  state  
update  rule  for  the  assignment  of  wi  to  a  topic  zi  is  given  by  the  formula   
  

p zi   j   zi w  

ni  j

 w i  

  

   ni  j

ni  j   w n j

 d i  

 d i  

 

  t

  

  
where  z i  is  the  assignment  of  all  zk  such  that  k    i   n i j wi   is  the  number  of  times  words  the  same  as  wi  have  been  assigned  
to  topic  j   n i j     is  the  total  number  of  words  assigned  to  topic  j   n i j di     is  the  number  of  words  in  the  document  containing  wi  that  
have  been  assigned  to  topic  j   a
nd  nj di   is  the  total  number  of  words  in  document  d   t  is  the  total  number  of  topics   w  is  the  size  of  
the  vocabulary   all  not  counting  the  assignment  of  the  wi   and    and    are  free  parameters  that  control  how  heavily  the  
distribution  is  smoothed          we  determined    and    experimentally   but  their  choice  did  not  have  a  visible  effect  on  our  results   
for  convergence  we  tested  the  cosine  distance  of  the  vector  for  each  topic  where  the  ith  entry  is  p wi z    where  wi  is  a  
distinct  word  in  the  vocabulary   not  the  word  in  the  ith  index   with  the  analogous  vector  previous  iteration     we  let  the  sampler  
burn  in  for      iterations  and  then  repeatedly  took  the  cosine  similarity  between  two  subsequent  iterations     once  the  cosine  
similarity  of  each  vector  with  the  previous  iterations  was  above  a  threshold  t  for      iterations   an  approximate  maximizing  
stationary  distribution  had  been  reached  for  each  of  the  topics     once  we  had  obtained  the  stationary  distribution  for  each  topic  
we  then  calculated  the  probability  of  each  congressperson  di  given  a  topic  zj   given  by    
  

fi p zk   j    

w k d i

  
since  a  word  and  a  document  are  conditionally  independent  given  a  topic     this  gives  a  distribution  over  topics   the  
 congressperson  multinomial   for  each  congressperson  i     where  a  p di zj   represents  the  portion  of  the  mixture  for  di  that  is  
composed  of  topic  zj    given  the  multinomial  distribution  
over  topics  for  every  congressperson   we  then  split  them  into  democratic  

and  republican  congressmen   and  averaged  their  distributions  over  topics   to  find  the  multinomial  distribution  over  topics  for  the  
 average   democratic  congressman   and  the  multinomial  distribution  over  topics  for  the   average   republican  congressman     
accordingly  d   average  democratic  distribution  is  r       
given  these  average  distributions  over  topics   we  then  visualized  the  difference  of  the  distributions  in  the  following  way     
we  took  the  p r z    p d z   for  each  topic  z   and  mapped  that  to  a  value  between     and        we  then  represented  each  topic  z  as  a  
circle   colored  with  red  proportional  to  p r z   and  blue  proportional  to  p d z      the  color  for  a  topic  was  given  by   red             
p r z    green         blue             p d z      a  topic  that  is  more  republicans  will  be  redder   and  a  topic  that  is  democratic  will  be  bluer     
given  this  visualization   the  presence  of  only  red  or  blue  topics  with  varying  brightness  suggests  that  republican  and  democrats  
tend  to  generate  their  votes  from  mutually  exclusive  sets  of  topics   and  accordingly  tend  to  vote  differently     the  presence  of  
purple  topics  suggests  that  there  are  issues  that  democrats  and  republicans  tend  to  vote  similarly  on     so  the  presence  of  only  red  
means  that  the  congress  at  this  time  was  more  bipartisan   with  congress people  having  less  mutual  topics  they  agreed  on   and  
accordingly  drew  their  votes  from       here  is  the  visualization  for  a  topic  model  k         with  the  cosine  similarity  threshold  for  each  
topic  t          

  
  
if  z   is  the  left  topic   and  z   is  the  right  topic   then  p r z                 p r z                 p d z               p d z                  
so  we  can  conclude  that  republicans  votes  were  mostly  generated  by  drawing  votes  from  the  z   whereas  democrats  votes  were  
generated  mostly  by  drawing  votes  from  z      accordingly  we  can  conclude  that  congress  at  this  time  was  more  bipartisan  
according  to  this  model   because  democrats  and  republicans  were  mostly  comprised  of  votes  drawn  from  mutually  exclusive  sets  
of  topics   
  
the     most  likely  votes  for  each  topic  are  presented  by  their  bill  number   and  likelihood  given  that  topic     the  top     for  
the  more  republican  topic  were   
  
    h  r         tax  increase  prevention  act  of         no           
    h  r        native  american  methamphetamine  enforcement  and  treatment  act  of         yes           
    h  r         u s   troop  readiness   veterans   care   katrina  recovery   and  iraq  accountability  appropriations  act          
no           
  
the  top     for  the  more  democratic  topic  were    
   h  r         trade  and  globalization  assistance  act  of         yes           
   h  r        water  quality  investment  act  of         yes           
   h  r         financial  services  and  general  government  appropriations  act          yes           
  

fi    we  performed  this  experiment  with  k                                 but  the  results  are  not  reproduced  here  for  lack  of  space   
the  strong  disparity  in  the  mixing  proportions  for  the  average  democrat  and  average  republican  suggests  that  congress  was  
strongly  divided   the  democrats  and  republicans  votes  being  generated  by  nearly  mutually  exclusive  distributions  over  votes   or  
political  issues   
  
conclusion  
  
our  goal  for  the  project  was  to  use  unsupervised  learning  techniques  to  find  clusters  of  politicians  with  the  same  
opinions  as  well  as  clusters  of  bills  on  the  similar  issues     in  the  end   we  were  able  to  successfully  apply  techniques  of  latent  
semantic  indexing  to  achieve  both  of  these  goals     our  most  interesting  results  included  discovery  of  republican  congressmen  with  
liberal  voting  records  as  well  as  discovery  of  a  small  set  of  topics  that  are  currently  most  important  to  the  congress
