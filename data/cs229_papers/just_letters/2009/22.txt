introduction

signal separation from mix has been an interest of research in recent years 
and many learning algorithms and variations have been developed  in this
paper we focus on separation of specific type of signal with practical application 
musical instrument signal separation  the result of such separation can be used
by amateur instrument players to listen to their part of a given music more
clearly  and learn how to play their part  we experiment with existing learning
algorithms to separate a single musical instrument from popular music mp  file 
this experiment will hopefully reveal particular nature of the target instrument
and we will be able to extend and modify the learning algorithm to get better
performance 

 

experimentation

idea is to use blind source separation unsupervised learning algorithms  for this
idea  we start with independent component analysis  and follow with different
and or extended algorithms to get better performance  many variations of ica
algorithms are implemented in icalab software package         icalab is
used extensively for the experiment 

 

using standard ica

for the experiment  we use mp  file of nirvanas smells like teen spirit  the
following two channels are first several seconds of the song 
using off the shelf ica algorithm returns two signals below 
though it is hard to see from the signal outputs  the first signal is almost
identcal to the original music  while the second result sounds louder and distorted when confirmed by converting back to mp  and play it

dynamical embedding

an interesting application of ica has been studied in neuroscience area in      in
the paper the authors apply standard ica algorithm to separate out different
brain signals from a single mixture of brain signals  they do so by using a
technique called dynamical embedding  assumption of dynamic embedding is
that the measured signal is due to non linear interaction of just a few degrees of
freedome  with additive noise  this suggests the existence of an unobservable
deterministic generator of the observed data  this is applied to music signal to
separate out independent components 
basic idea is to construct dynamic embedding matrix out of a series of delay
vectors from the mixture  then feed it to standard ica algorithm  one way to
construct a de matrix is from a series of delay vectors taken from the observed
data x t   where the state of the unobservable system at time t  x t   is given
by
x t    x t      x t            x t   m      

 

   

fiwhere  is the lag and m is the number of lags or the embedding dimension 
let n stand for the number of delay vectors then de matrix is given by

results

in order to ease the inspection of results in signals  i have instead run the
algorithm with a mixture of two signals  one signal representing a vocal sound 
the other representing musical instrument playing along with the vocal  also 
these are truly single channel wave file format  the following represents the two
original signals  and mixture of the two

conclusion

the result signals show some resemblance to the original signals  and it is interesting to use the standard ica algorithm  which usually requires as many
signals as the number of sources  to separate a single channel mixture without changes to the algorithm  although the results are not as clean as some
other more complex techniques  it should be interesting to see how changing the
parameters could give better results
