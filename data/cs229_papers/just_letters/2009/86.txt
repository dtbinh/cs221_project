introduction
statistical arbitrage is the application of modern statistics  significant computing power 
and large data sets to the discovery of financial market mispricing and then exploiting those
inefficiencies for profit  fundamental analysis is the process of analyzing all public company
disclosures including financial statements in the attempt to uncover indicators of future company
performance  in this paper  we endeavor to combine both approaches to investing in pursuit of
superior risk adjusted returns 
there are a large number of market participants with different views on the correct
valuation of varying securities and these participants constantly update their own market outlook
and security views  the information a market participant may consider relevant on one day may
be considered insignificant by the same individual one month later  the markets are in a constant
state of flux of what is critical for security valuation and the monetary value to ascribe to this
information 
support vector machine  svm  is currently one of the most popular learning algorithms
and has successfully been applied to numerous fields  its popularity can be explained both by a
high generalization performance and a mathematically well posed training method  in the context
of financial data modeling  svm is particularly appealing for multiple reasons  firstly  it makes
no strong assumptions on the data  secondly  since it is not an empirical error minimization
method  therefore it should not over fit the data  these two reasons explain why svm compares
well to other methods commonly used for financial forecasting such as arima of artificial
neural networks  see  caotay      further  in our context of incorporating several features  we
need an algorithm that handles high dimensional data well  which is the case for svm 

objectives
we chose to focus on the oil sector of the s p    stock index  there are seven stocks in
this group including well known firms such as exxon mobil and hess corp  this group of
companies offers homogeneous products leaving them to compete on superior business execution
and overall firm financial management  since there is no significant product differentiation  we
believe security valuation is highly related to financial statement metrics indicating company
execution that investors continually decide are more and less important during the evolution of
time 
we chose to use the svm to classify the relative performance of the stock against the
performance of other stocks in the sector  then we manage a portfolio making investments
decision entirely based on the classification made by the learning algorithm  we long  buy  the
stocks that are expected to outperform  and short  sell  the stocks that are expected to
underperform the sector  using this approach  we are not buying stocks on the expectation that
they will rise and selling stocks on the expectation the stock price will fall  instead  we are buying
stocks on the expectation that the price of the outperformers will rise more than the price of the
underperformers or the price of the outperformers will fall less than the price of the

fiunderperformers  in this manner  we are only predicting the relative performance of one portfolio 
outperformers  relative to the other  underperformers 
the following table includes the fundamental measures we used to input into the svm
algorithm 
we surveyed several academic papers   abarbanellbushee      
 abarbanellbushee        levthiagarajan        nicoletti       that described the connection
between several of these measures and stock prices  furthermore  we included obvious measures
like historical oil price  which should have a strong correlation to the stock prices for companies
in the oil sector  or information about the trading volume  also  the features are presented in what
we expected to be the decreasing order of importance of the features 

inputs
historical price
trading volume
historical oil prices
p e ratio
enterprise value   ebitda
current assets   current liabilities
total assets   total liabilities
percentage of analysts recommending
buy and sell
investing cash flow   depreciation
market capitalization   operating cash
flow
market capitalization   revenue
operating cash flow   revenue
net increase  decrease  cash   revenue

underlying connection

large driver of industry costs
number of years of earnings equivalent to the current
company value
metric widely used in private equity to gauge company
value
indicates whether the company may have near term
financial distress
rough indication of the residual value of the company
reflects the opinions of company outsiders that closely
follow the firm
indicates whether the firm is adequately investing for the
future
similar to pe ratio  but with an accounting metric not
easily manipulated
the value of the firm relative to    of revenue
percentage of each revenue dollar the firm turns into
operating cash flow
percentage of each revenue dollar the firm turns into cash

designing our experiments
an svm classifier was applied on each one of the   stocks in the oil sector  our data set
contains daily values of the inputs presented in the table above during the period from january
     to november       our goal was to forecast what would happen on a particular day using
only measures obtained from the   previous days  we used the first   years of data to train the
algorithm then made forecasts and invested on a daily basis during the remaining   years 
using twice the amount of data for training than for testing is a common practice when
applying svm classifier  further  we believe that the previous   days convey enough information
to forecast the next days performance 
the inputs we selected were transformed whenever we believe the evolution conveyed
more information than the absolute value itself  to us  past stock prices  past index  and trading
volume all fall in that category  the first two were transformed into daily returns and volume was
used to derive the difference of the current volume and a moving average mean 
the svm algorithm was specified to use the gaussian kernel  the resulting algorithm
therefore has two parameters  the cost of misclassifying and the bandwidth of the kernel  these
two parameters were determined using a    fold cross validation method 

fithe results we present in the next paragraph were obtained using the ls svmlab
toolbox for matlab referenced  toolbox  lssvm  

results
here we present the results we obtained using respectively      and    features 
the forecasting performance is presented in the table below 

the algorithm generally predicts correctly more often than incorrectly  also  having more
features tends to give a better rate of accurate forecasts but the difference of performance is low

forecasts

having a better rate with more than one feature tells us that the additional features would contain
more information than the stock price itself 
our conclusion is that adding the last   features is not worth the additional complexity 
next  we present the evolution of the corresponding portfolios 
using   feature 

fiusing   features 

using    features 

the performance of the first portfolio is misleading  one should note that the algorithm
did not perform well in terms of forecasting with only one feature  also  looking at the results
using   and    features  it is hard to see whether the trading strategy would be appropriate only
up to some limited time after the last date of the training set 

conclusion
an svm classifier was successfully applied to forecast relative performance within the
oil sector  the forecasts made are good in terms of the percentage of accurate guesses  also  our
results tend to show that the features we selected do contain information relating to future
performance  furthermore  it was clearly illustrated that those predictions  even though they have
an acceptable rate of good guesses would not necessarily lead to profitable strategies 
there are many reasons why we believe that the application of svm to financial
forecasting is still very promising  further work should focus on investigating the selection of
other meaningful inputs among which could be price volatility  current trend  and other financial
ratios or out of the sector market factors  it would be beneficial if additional transformations such
as returns over several periods  scaling  detecting and removing outliers from the data set be
carried out using the inputs  see  caotay      for more details 
in order to derive a better trading strategy  one could consider applying this method over
longer time scales  as a matter of fact  we placed ourselves in the position of over trading  our

fiportfolios rate of return would have suffered a lot from taking in to account transaction costs  on
the other hand  forecasting further in the future is more difficult because one no longer benefits
from market persistence 
additional improvements could also address how to adapt svm to the specific purpose
of forecasting financial data  researchers l  cao and f  tay have devoted many research papers
to this topic  suggesting innovative ideas such as giving more weight to recent training data
 taycao    a   or experts  cao      to take non stationarity into account
