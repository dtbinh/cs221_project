introduction
the prediction of the function of a novel
gene remains to be a challenging
problem  given a piece of coding
sequence  one can deduce its function by
finding homologous genes using
sequence or protein structural alignment 
one can also perform gene expression
measurements or gene knockout
experiments to determine the function of
a gene  however  a gene may not have
homology with any known gene and
experiments can be expensive  it would
therefore be beneficial if the function of
a gene can be predicted from the
characteristics of its coding sequence 
one such characteristics is synonymous
codon usage 
proteins are strings of amino acids and
their sequences are translated from
nucleotide sequences using the genetic
code  which is a set of trinucleotide
sequences  each trinucleotide is termed a
codon  proteins are constructed from   
different amino acids  yet there are     
   different codons  the genetic code is
therefore redundant   most amino acids
are encoded by more than one codon
 table     trinucleotide sequences
coding for the same amino acids are
referred to as synonymous codons  the
usage of synonymous codons is not
random  some codons are preferred
over the others for a given amino acid
and such perference varies among
species as well as among genes within a
species 
it has been shown that for a number of
organisms such as yeast  bacteria  plants 

insect  and mammals  genes can be
clustered into groups that have different
expression patterns and functions based
on codon usage      in this project  i
focused
on
baker s
yeast
 saccharomyces cerevisiae   which is a
unicellular eukaryote that has been
studied extensively as a model organism 
sharp et  al demonstrated that yeast
genes can be seggregated into two main
clusters with different expression levels
based on synonymous codon usage     
najafabadi et  al showed that coexpressed genes in yeast have similar
synonymous codon usage and that codon
usage can improve the prediction of
protein protein interaction in organisms
including yeast        here  i would like
to build a classifier to predict the
function of a gene  using yeast as a
model

methods
data
yeast genes that participated in various
molecular pathways were retrieved from

fithe kegg  kyoto encyclopedia of
genes and genomes  pathway database 
the categories chosen for this study
included those involved in metabolism 
dna replication and transcription 
translation  and cellular processes 
details of the chosen pathways are
presented in table    coding sequences
of the genes were retrieved from the
saccharomyces
genome
database
 sgb   duplicated copies of genes
within the same category were removed 
genes that were found in more than one
categories were ignored  only genes
with more than     codons were
considered  the final data set had    
genes 
feature space
there are    different codons  however 
since methionine and tryptophan have
only   corresponding codon  these two
codons do not contribute to the
measurement of codon usage and are
removed from the analysis  also  stop
codons that signal the termination of
transcription are also removed  each
gene is therefore represented by a vector
containing    elements  each element
corresponds to the relative synonymous
codon usage frequency  rscu   fij

x ij
n

  i
  x ij
n i j  

where xij is the number of ocurrences of
synonymous codon j of amino acid i and
ni is the number of synonymous codons
encoding for amino acid i  this measure
can be interpreted as the observed
number of occurrence of codon i versus
the expected number of occurrence of
codon i given an amino acid j assuming
uniform distribution  it has the
advantage of removing the effect of

amino acid composition on the codon
usage profile of a gene  since a gene
does not necessarily carry all    amino
acids  a pseudo count      was added for
every codon 
data analysis
calculation of codon usage and building
of learning algorithms were done in
matlab 
supervised learning algorithms
   softmax regression
softmax regression is an example of
generalized linear model applied to
multinomial data  the model takes the
feature vector of each gene with its label
in the training set and output the
probabilities of a test sample being in the
different classes  the parameters were
found by maximizing the log likelihood
with batch gradient ascent  the class
with the higest probability was chosen to
be the predicted class 
   support vector machines  svm 
ma et  al     demonstrated the use of
svm for the classification of human
leukocyte antigens using codon usage 
svms are inherently a two class model
but they can be extended to multiple
classes  two common ways are the oneversus all method  where k svm models
are built  one for each of the k classes  a
test sample is assigned to the class that
classifies it with the largest margin  the
second approach is the one versus one
model  where k k      models are built 
each model is built for a pair of the
classes  the label of a test sample will
be the class that are chosen by most
models  here  i used the later approach 
evaluation of learning algorithms
ten fold cross validation was used to
evaluate the performance of the

ficlassifiers  briefly  the data set was
partitioned into    subsets of
approximately equal size  each subset
containing equal proportion of genes
from each category  in each validation 
nine subsets were used for training and

the remaining subset was used for
testing  the testing error was calculated
as the average of the testing errors from
all ten validations

results
principal component analysis
the data set of     yeast genes  each
represented by a feature vector of   
elements  was subject to principal
component analysis  the first two principal
components explained     and      of the
total variance  repsectively  figure   shows
the representation of each gene in the space
spanned by the first two princiapl
components  it was obvious from figure  
that different functional categories of genes
occupied different spaces defined by the first
two components  except for the categories of
dna replication transcription and cellular
processes  figure    right panels   these two
groups were thus grouped together for the
building of gene function classifiers 
interestingly  ten of the genes partitcipating
in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway
were located in unique location in the

dna replication 
transcription
dna replication
base excision repair
nucleotide excision repiar
mismatch repair
ubiquitin

principal component space  figure    bottom
panel   further exmination of the data set
revealed that they were genes in the
mitochondria  a dna continaing organelle
that participates in energy metabolism in
eukaryotes and is believed to be derived
from endosymbiotic prokaryotes  it was
therefore not surprising that mitochondrial
genes have synonymous codon usage very
different from nuclear genes  none of the
other pathways contained mitochondrial
genes  these ten genes were removed from
the data set for training  the final data set
thus consisted of     nuclear genes 
figure   is a plot of the contribution of each
codon to the first two principal components 
one interesting observation was that codons
ending with a or t contributed positively to
the second principal component while those
ending with g or c contributed negatively

softmax regression
using batch gradient descent with a learning
rate of         yeast genes were classified into
  categories based on their codon usage  table

  shows the confusion matrix summed over all
ten validations  i e  each cross validation
generated a confusion matrix and table   is the
sum of all    confusion matrices  such that
each gene was classified once   the average
test error  percentage of genes misclassified 
was         which was close to the training
error  most of the genes in category  
 metabolism  that were misclassified fell into
category    dna replication  translation 
cellular processes   the specificity of category
   number of true category   genes   number of
genes classified into category    was quite low 

fi      this was not surprising  since some of
the category   genes fell into similar space
defined by the first two principal components
as category    figure

both svms involving category i gave the same
prediction i  if the prediction of any two svms
disagreed  no prediction was made for the gene
and such event was termed  uninformative

slack variables  were experimented  tables

using polynomial  linear  quadratic  and cubic

overfitting  as seen from the increase in training
error  quadratic and cubic kernels tended to
overfit the data  as observed from the zero
training error and relatively high test error
rates  linear kernels performed better than
cubic and quadratic kernels  the best error rate
of the multi class svm was         which
was obtained using a gaussian kernel  such

conclusion
the function of yeast genes could be predicted
fairly well based solely on the coding
sequences  in this study  one versus one
support vector machine with a gaussian kernel
performed better than softmax regression  it
would be interesting to investigate whether the
use of codon usage for gene prediction could be
extended to other organisms including higher
level eukaryotes
