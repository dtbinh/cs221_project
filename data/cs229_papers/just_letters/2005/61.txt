identification of heterozygous point mutation events in dna sequencing chromatograms 
introduction 
the recent discovery of activating somatic mutations in cancer that correlate with phenotypes such as drug responsiveness  has
generated renewed interest in the sequencing of genomes of tumor samples and cancer cancer cell lines with the goal of identifying the
set of mutations that produce those phenotypes      the two most popular strategies for discovering these events are array cgh     
and direct sequencing of tumor samples and cells at specific loci of genes suspected a priori to be involved in tumor proliferation and
survival  the latter technique involves using pcr amplification of the loci of interest and standard capillary electrophoresis dna
sequencing to generate chromatograms and sequences which are then compared to a reference normal sequence to reveal mutations 
the detection of homozygous events is relatively straightforward  but the identification of heterozygous point events is problematic 
the process of detecting heterozygous events involves detecting  peaks within peaks  of chromatogram waveforms and is plagued by
a variety of artifacts in these signals which can potentially generate false positives  proposed herein is a detection algorithm based on
a classifier which distinguishes candidate  peaks within peaks  that are heterozygous point mutations from those that are false
positives based on statistics about the candidate event and representation of these artifacts as interval scale input variables to a
machine learning algorithm 
background 
standard dna sequencing technology using capillary eletrophoresis produces a chromatogram and a nucleotide sequence called by a
base caller algorithm  fig     

fig   
the output of the sequencer and basecaller is a binary file containing the four raw electrophoresis curves  one for each base g c a and
t   a vector indicating the locations within the curves at which the bases were called  shown graphically in figure   as vertical dashed
white lines   and a vector of the call quality     at each base  an integer from   to      equal to        log probability of error in the
base call   according to the base caller algorithm  
heterozygous point mutations manifest as peaks within peaks  fig     but are easily confused with a variety of artifacts including
background noise  fig      cross talk  dye blobs  fig      end run noise  fig

classification of training data 
one existing successful approach to identifying these events relies on the anti correlation of the waveform of interest with respect to a
waveform averaged from a pool of wild type or normal samples      one embodiment of this approach is used by a program called
mutation surveyor  the output of which was used to supply the training data for the classifier described here 
attributes 
proposed here is an algorithm which does not rely on such a pool of normal samples  and instead classifies events for a single
chromatogram in isolation  solely by the local attributes of the chromatogram  the input to the classification algorithm is generated
by locating in the chromatogram  in each channel  local maxima that do not correspond to a called base at that position  non call
peaks   this produces four  possibly empty  sets of positions ma    a    aa  a number of non call local maxima   mg    g    gg  
mc    c    cc   mt    t    tt   the peaks in these peak sets represent the candidates for classification  a classification of positive
constitutes the event detector 
the first and probably most important input variable for each peak is some measure of the magnitude of the local maxima with respect
to its neighborhood  for each candidate peak  its full width half maximum  fwhm normalized by the base calling pitch and its
height compared to the average call peaks of the same channel peakratio  fig    in some neighborhood         bases  are calculated 
notice that the fwhm attribute was chosen as it appears that it may be useful for both rejecting noise peaks  with small width  and
rejecting dye blobs  with large peak widths  

fig    peak ratio   g  g 
also calculated for each peak is the proportional displacement of the peak with respect to its closest call peak normalized by the base
calling pitch in the neighborhood  posdisp  fig      this attribute should help to distinguish noise peaks as peaks with a larger
posdisp are increasingly likely to be noise as they do not spatially coincide with the most proximal base 

fig    proportional displacement   d d
for the purposes of eliminating potential false positives caused by regions of poor signal to noise ratio  the average local call quality in
the neighborhood  not including the base over the peak of interest  is included as an attribute  avequal  as is the specific call quality
of the base over the peak of interest  qual  we would expect the avequal attribute to be proportionally related to the likelihood of a
positive  good surrounding base call quality implies that peak of interest is not likely to be noise   the specific call quality of the base
over the peak of interest  qual  we would expect to relate inversely with the likelihood of a true positive  poor quality at the call over
the peak implies a large significant underlying peak and likely positive  
inspection of typical chromatograms demonstrates the ubiquitous presence of unusually high levels of noise at both the beginning and
end of the waveform  referred to as end run noise above  in anticipation of the fact that avequal  which will sample the left and right
neighborhood of a peak  might not be an accurate estimate of whether or not the peak of interest is near the extremes of the waveform 
two additional attributes  maxqual and minqual  which represent the maximum and minimum of the two averages produced by
only sampling from right and left of the peak  the attribute minqual might be expected to serve as a good indicator of whether a
particular candidate peak is near the end of the waveform as this would produce a low left or right flanking average base call quality 
finally  a measure of how the peak in question compares to the distribution of other background peaks in the same channel  which
should be mostly noise  is calculated the z score of the peak in question with respect to the average and standard deviation of all the
background peaks in the same channel  this attribute is called lzscore 

fiin summary  the attributes are thus  peakratio  lzscore  fwhm  posdisp  qual  avequal  maxqual and minqual 
data collection 
a program was written to parse chromatograms to yield the attributes mentioned above  the set of attributes were collected for    
heterozygous point mutations detected in     chromatograms by mutation surveyor  these     data points represent the
positives of the training data set  the set of negatives were gathered by processing    chromatograms classified by mutation
surveyor as wild type  meaning they should have no events  and collecting attributes for all non call peaks in the    wild type
chromatograms  this yielded        negative data points as the number of non event background peaks vastly outnumbers the
number of heterozygous mutation event peaks 
training 
visual inspection of the dimension pair wise plot of a hypercube including a     margin around the hypercube containing all the
positive data  fig     shows that the data is not trivially separable by any pair of dimensions  although peakratio  lzscore and the
neighborhood quality metrics show promise  a linear and radial kernel svm      logistic regression and a regression tree model
 pruned by    fold cross validation and a   se rule for the optimal tree      were trained on randomly sampled subsets of the
training data of increasing size for ten iterations  their total error  false positive and false negative rates averaged for the ten iterations
on each training data set size were tabulated  fig     

fig  
the svm and logistic regression models seem to not improve substantially with larger training data set sizes  suggesting an inherent
bias problem and possible poor lack of fit to the classification problem  the regression tree model seemed to improve steadily on all
error rates  suggesting that the model may converge further for larger training data sets and seems to converge to a lower general error
rate and  more importantly  a lower false negative rate when trained on all the data  one might imagine a radial kernel svm to be
capable of recapitulating quite accurately the decision boundary of a regression tree  so the fact that the regression tree exceeds the
performance of the radial kernel svm for a large enough data set size is a bit surprising  this is suggestive of some possible sharp
angles or high dimensional corners in the optimal decision boundary  these could possibly be mirroring fixed thresholds inherent in
the mutation surveyor software used to supply the training data 
the optimal pruned tree  fig      shows that a majority of the positives classify by the lzscore  minqual and peakratio and a majority
of the negatives classify by lzscore and peakratio 

fig   

fiimprovements 
manual inspection of some of the most frequently misclassified true positives shows that even when the background peak might be
weak  often the foreground peak is measurably reduced in amplitude in the presence of a heterozygous event  this suggests that one
might add an additional parameter to measure how attenuated the foreground peak is compared to the neighboring call peaks of the
same channel  usually  although not always  chromatogram readouts come in pairs  one chromatogram produced from a pcr reaction
on the forward strand of dna and one independently produced from a pcr reaction on the reverse strand  exploiting the
corroboration expected between forward and reverse strand readouts would allow one to train a machine learning algorithm with an
asymmetric loss structure favoring false positives over false negatives and use corroboration to further eliminate false positives
