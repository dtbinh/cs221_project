i  i ntroduction

i

n a wireless sensor network  the data collected from
different sensor nodes needs to be correlated together for a
meaningful interpretation and application  this often requires
relating sensor data to its physical location  localization form
the very first step in the sensor network based applications 
the majority of the localization algorithms use information
such as time of arrival of signal  angle of arrival of signal
 using directional antennas  or rssi measurements for localization  typically  rssi is not the most accurate indicator
for device location as it can be subject to various multi path
and fading effects  which may also be varying randomly over
time  the other parameters like the angle of arrival and timing
based indicators provide more accurate observations relating
to the location of the node  however  they require a dedicated
hardware co located with the sensor node for logging and
providing this information  in case of rssi  the information
is already available to the sensor node and no extra hardware
is required  this is particularly useful for energy constraint
nodes 
the traditional localization approach use range estimate
as the first step in the localization process  using signal
propagation models  as estimate is formed about the distance
between a pair of points  however  accuracy of such scheme
is limited by the ranging errors  range free localization from
rssi data is a non standard problem and there have been only
few attempts so far in this diretion  in      authors described
a simple nearest neighbour classification algorithm to obtain
coarse localization of objects  a kernel based localization
algorithm is proposed in     
motivated by the nature of the problem and some recent
work in this area  we explore the use of a learning algorithm
for solving this problem  we present a new approach to this
problem and discuss and analyze some schems for estimating
locations from rssi data 
this report is organized as following  in section ii  the problem statement is introduced  we give a deatiled description of

our approach in section iii which forms the major part of
this report  the performance of various proposed schemes is
analyzed in section iv  conclusions are given in section v

a  problem statement
let x    x        xm   xm         xm n denote the locations
of m   n sensor nodes in r    we assume that position
of first m nodes are unknown and represent this set by
xu    x    x        xm    also  we assume that position of
last n nodes are known and represent this set by xk  
 xm     xm         xm n    we call the nodes in xk as becon
nodes  in general n    m  for every pair of nodes  i  j  we
are gievn sij   the signal strength that sensor j receives from
node i  our problem is to recover the positions of all the nodes
 xu  
b  brief description of algorithm
given any pair of nodes  xi   xj    we train svm to assign
label   to it if   xi  xj       ro or   otherwise  where the
choice of ro is up to us  training is done on the set of becon
nodes  we form a feature vector which is robust to signal
variations  once we have this pairwise classification output 
we map the svm output to probability by fitting the data to
a logistic regression as described in      our intution is that
a pair of points which are very close will be assigned label  
with probability close to   and points which are very far apart
will be assigned label   with probability very close to    we
then use this pairwise probability to estimate the postion of
unknown nodes by various schemes as described in the next
section 
iii  d etailed description of the algorithm
a  training svm and classification
consider a pair of nodes  i  j   our intution is that two
nodes are close in space if they receive the similar signal
strengths from all the other nodes  thus  the feature vector
for nodes  i  j  is given by i  j  where its k th element
 
  this choice of feature vector
 i  j k   exp   siksjk  

makes system robust to fading and interference  which is
commonly observed in wireless signals  so  if there is some
obstruction in the line of sight between node i and node k
and if node j is close to node i then sjk will also show the
variations similar to that observed in sik   note that to reduce
the training complexity  we can conside only those nodes k
for which at least one of sik or sjk have value greater than

fi 

some pre determined threshold  though  we havent done this
in our current implementation 
with this choice of features  we train the svm to answer
if the distance between a pair of nodes is less than ro  
all possible pairs of becon nodes are used for training  we
implement this using smo algorithm with l  regularization
     once trained  we store the classification output in matrix
y and value of svm before thresholding in a matrix s where
yij     if svm output for nodes  i  j  is     and yij    
otherwise  similarly  sij   wt  i  j   b denotes svm output
for nodes  i j  before thresholding 
b  mapping svm output to probability
we use the approach given in     to map svm to probability  this is done by first fitting the parameters of a logistic
 
and then evaluting
regression function g s      exp as b 
g sij   for each sij  s  this gives us a matrix p where
pij   g sij     p    xi  xj       ro   
for fitting the parameters a and b  we form following loglikelihood function and maximize is with respect to to a and
b 
x
 a  b    arg max
 t f  log g f          t f   log g f    
a b

f

   
where f is svm output for a pair of becon nodes after it has
been trained on the becon nodes and t f  is the corresponding
lable which takes value   and   instead of   and   
in order to get an unbiased estimate of the probability  we
split the training data into three parts  trained svm on all
combinations of two out of three  and used the output of that
svm on the third part and corresponding labels of third part
for fitting logistic regression parameters 
c  estimating locations
we use the matrix p obtained earlier for estimating the
locations  one possible approach is to write the position of
node i as the weighted sum of its neighbours 
x
xi  
wij xij
   
jn  i 

where n  i  denoted the neighbours of node i which can be
taken as those nodes j for which entries ci j is    an obvious
way method to choose wij is to take them in proportion
to pij   a sequential algorithm can be formed as follows 
we first find the position of nodes which has maximum
number of neighbour with known locations  for the very first
pass  the node with maximum number of becon nodes in its
neighbourhood   we compute the location of this node as
the weighted sum of locations of its neigbours with known
locations  as further node locations becomes known  they help
in locating other nodes  this scheme is very simple but is
prone to error propogation  fig    shows the outcome of such
scheme 
an alternative would be to use joint detection which tries
to minimize
m
m n
x

i  

if pu   qu   ru and pk   qk   rk are column vectors denoting the
x y and z co ordinates of nodes in xu and xk respectively 
and if we partition weight matrix w as w    wu wk   then
it can be shown that minimizing     gives
pu    wut wu  wut  wu   i    wk pk  wut wk xk      
and similar expressions can be obtained for qu and ru   we
call this as m inn orm  scheme 
though  we are doing a joint detection  when positions of all
the nodes are unknown  a trivial solution for     is given when
all the nodes are at single point  in presence of some becon
nodes  nodes wont stick to one point but they will still have
the tendency of converging towards the center since number
of becon nodes are very small compared to unknown nodes
as shown in fig     an alternative would be to minimize first
norm instead of second norm  but this improves the results
only by a small margin 
a better solution is given by an application of laplace
eigenmaps      this involves minimizing the cost function

the constraints remove the translation ambiguity and the
tendency to put all the points at origin  we take the weights
wi j   pi j   the intution behind using this optimization
problem is that nodes for which pi j is close to   are likely to
be close and nodes for which pi j is close to zero are likely
to be far apart 
p
let w denote the weight matrix  we define ui   j wij
and l   diag u            un    w   let  k   bf vk   be the
eigne value decomposition of l which are arranged in the
increasing order by magnitude of eigenvalues  then the optimal lowest cost   dimsensional solution to     is given by
zi    v   i          v   i t  
however  the co ordinate system for zi  s and xi s are
different  we map zi to xi by the follwong way  we assume
that in a noise free environment xi are obtained from zi by
an affine transformation
xi   azi   b

   

where a is      matrix and b is a      matrix  we estimate
a and b by posing a least square error problem over becon
nodes estimate given by xi  s and zi  s 
x
 a  b    arg min
  azi   b  xi    
   
a b

ixk

once we know a and b  we map back to the original coordinate system by using      the results are shown in fig 
  
a similar approach based on nodes connectivity has been
tried in     but our approach differ in a sense that we have a
definite scheme for choosing weights by using svm probability values and we propose the use of an affine transformation
to go back to the original co ordinate system

we test the validity of the algorithm by simulation  we use
the signal model described in     for evaluting the performance  each sensor location x is assumed to receive from a
sensor located at x  a signal value

model  s x  x      exp    xx
 
is the independently generated gaussina random variable with
zero mean and variance     this has nothing to do with the
choice of the feature vector and a polynomial decay function
was found to give similar reuslts 
simulations are carried out for three different values of
noise power                     while         is kept
fixed  the percentage classification errors for these values
of noise were found to be                 respectively  the
parameters for fine localization error is presented in table    
where the values are normalized  so they repesent the error
that would have occured in an area of       as expected  the
performance deteriorates with the increase in the noise power 
moreover  laplace eigenmaps perform much better than the
other schemes 
fig    shows the outcome of a typical initial calssification
stage  here the all the points which are within ro distance
from center node are marked withing the large circle  a blue
point means a classification label   while a red point means
a classification label    figs      show the outcome of
the sequential  m inn orm  and laplace eigenmaps schemes
respectively for the worst case noise power of      blue dots
denote the true position of sensor nodes while red dots denote
their estimated position  a cross denotes a becon node 
we also tried to test out algorithm on the actual data    
for chipcon cc      since our data consisted had only   
nodes which were partially connected only  we were not able
to perform the inital classification with good accuracy  we
obtained percentage classification error to be arond     but
this was mainly due to very small number of nodes and an
even smaller fraction of becon nodes on which training was
done  we intend to evaluate our alogrithm on a large network
of actual sensor nodes in near future

attempts can be made to reduce the complexity of the training
phase by a good choice of kernel which doesnt require
computing feature explicitly  or by limiting the size of the
feature vector  a study can be made to find better schemes
for choosing the weights or to find the optimal weights  a
distribute version of the algorithm can also be developed

we present a new learning algorithm for ad hoc sensor
network localization and show that mapping output of svm to
probability followed by application of lapalce eigenmaps and
affine transformation gives a good estimate of node locations
from rssi data only  our algorithm is particularly useful in a
dense sensor network 
our contribution in this project is to show a completely
different approach to solving a difficult problem of localization
from rssi data  we do not claim that our algorithm is better
than the existing ones but we show that a learning algorithm
can be applied for this problem 
our immediate future goal is to test the algorithm on a large
actual sensor network  we would also like to use apply thin
plate spline transformation instead of affine transformation
to map back to the original co ordinate system once we have
the outcome of the laplace eigenmaps  current implementation
of svm has high computational complexity for the training
