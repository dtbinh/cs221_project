abstract 
we propose to create an automatic image filter to recognize offensive digital images that contain violent 
sexual and other explicit material  our initial system focuses on filtering sexually explicit and nude images 
to build it  we first identify relevant features and train learners to recognize them  we use computer vision
 cv  to extract both color and edge based features  and supervised machine learning  ml  algorithms such
as logistic regression and svm to train  currently considered features are skin pixels  skin cluster layouts 
simple body parts  specific edges and skin variations across edges  we then create single feature based or
related feature set based weak image classifiers that we test and tune for lowest classification error  finally 
we combine these weak classifiers to test how different features do together  our main combination method
is to attach weights to each classifier and train them to get a final strong hypothesis  the overall result is a
fairly accurate explicit image classification framework         accurate   where modular weak classifiers
can be added and removed for further improvement  we test our features and algorithms on image sets
returned by googles image search  our main concern is accuracy  and our secondary concern is speed 
major limitations on the current state of the art  our approach is novel since  although ml work on general
object recognition exists  ml has not been used by most current solutions that classify sexually explicit
images  and none have used it with cv 
   introduction
in todays age of the media internet  all manner of images have become available online  in copious
amounts  in fact  one of the more rapidly growing areas in search technology today is image search  with
this availability comes the natural need to filter offensive content  to prevent explicit images from reaching
the wrong eyes  many solutions exist today  such as filters that are part of image search engines like those of
google or yahoo   and commercially available stand alone filters like contentprotect or netnanny  as any
user of these services is aware  while they are very good at filtering websites and text  they often fail to
remove offensive images  the reasons are clear in that current internet image search technology is based
upon words  rather than image content       as images are obtained by using the image filename or text that
surrounds the image on a webpage      even though attempts have been made to search using actual image
semantics         it remains a largely unsolved problem and thus  it is no surprise that image filters also use
the same methods as search  in that they screen for the text and web pages to do with the image  but not the
image itself 
methods that process actual images exist  such as extracting nudes using skin filtering and geometric
shape matching of limbs      or classification methods using wavelet transforms of images and matching
them to those in a database      also  companies like vima technologies have actual commercially
available solutions      while these methods directly address the problem  many suffer from inaccuracy  the
first one only finds     of positive nudes       or exhibit a lack of speed that hinders use in real world
situations  the second method requires up to   seconds for an image to be processed       most of the
solutions do not employ machine learning  ml  techniques  and those that do  like vima technologies  do
not use computer vision  cv  
due to the nature of ml and the fact that it has been used in object recognition      as well as the fact
that visual image features need to be extracted  applying ml and cv together to the abstract problem of
classifying offensive images seems like a natural choice  and it is our aim to do so  we thus create weak
classifiers for single relevant features or sets of related features  and we elaborate on those methods below 
for all the classifiers and their combination  we also display the results obtained  currently  our system is
concerned with images containing nude and sexually explicit material  to test the algorithms and features of

fiour framework  we use googles image search to provide representative sets of images  appropriate since
these images represent those most popularly viewed or linked to on the internet 
   method   results
overall strategy
to construct our system we first identify relevant features by studying our images of interest  and by
referring to previous work on the subject such as      for each feature or related set of features  we then
attempt to extract either color data  edge data or both as appropriate  using cv  and then train a hypothesis to
recognize the features from this data  thus  we build a single weak classifier based on this related feature
set  which is trained on our actual images to recognize when one is explicit  the weak classifiers are created
using modified ml algorithms such as logistic regression and svm  and we test with different algorithms
and tuned values to produce the least estimated generalization error  thus  we can compare individual
features and related feature sets to empirically evaluate which are most valuable  in a manner close to
forward search of wrapper model feature selection  we finally go on to combine unrelated feature sets to
find which combined sets are most valuable  currently  we combine by weighing each separate classifier
according to their performances on small test sets  resulting in a single weighted classifier  the entire system
is a general explicit image classification framework  where new feature based weak classifiers can be added
and tuned to facilitate future work and improvements  for a clearer picture of the system architecture  please
see diagram   in the appendix 
we will now discuss our data sets  and then go through each classifier below  please note  all
results shown are accuracies of weak or combined classifiers running on our actual test images to
classify them as explicit or not  finally  note that we use the term weak classifier loosely  as some of our
classifiers do fairly well on their own  especially when compared to the combined result 
data and testing
we have built an image crawler that  given a query  uses googles image search and downloads a
specified amount of images from those returned  we have used the query sex to get the set of positive data
and the query things  based on      to get negative data  all data was gone through and labeled by hand 
and the positive data categorized  so that we could see what specific categories of sexually explicit images
our feature sets or methods did well or poorly on  categories included groups of people  more than one skin
color  etc 
the data in the end was     images  specifically 
      training examples      positive and     negative 
      test examples      positive and     negative 
this is         split  and we appropriately then use hold out cross validation to measure the
estimated generalization errors of different algorithms and feature sets  we argue that the number of training
examples we have is enough for our current work according to vapniks theorem  since the largest amount of
parameters in all our main classifier is     thus  the number of training examples we need to minimize
training error is linear in    at most         of parameters is a good rule of thumb  as prof  ng mentioned in
class  which we exceed 
classifier    skin pixel percentage threshold
we use a skin filter to detect percentages of skin pixels in an image  based on the work of forsyth
and fleck      our current use of skin differs already from that of forsyth and fleck as we consider skin a
feature and not as necessary condition  nor do we assign a hard limit to how much skin is required  rather  we
learn it  please see figures       in the appendix to see an example of the skin filter at work  here  we learn

fithe skin colored pixel percentage threshold for the entire image that is most likely to indicate sexually
explicit material  this is our most basic classifier  concerning just one value  so we use logistic regression 
results 
accuracy is not very high  but fair considering the simplicity of this classifier 
training set error                 accuracy
test set error                 accuracy
classifier    skin cell layout  method  
this classifier is also based on skin  but uses the information in a smarter way  via cell
decomposition  the image is divided into a grid of cells  and each cell is labeled as a skin cell or not
depending on whether     of it contains skin colored pixels  we obtain a feature vector with an entry for
each cell that has the value   if the cell is skin and   if not  and pass this into an svm 
here we can vary the kernel  the constant c  and the number of rows   cols of the grid to find the
best accuracy  we tried linear  gaussian and spline kernels and found that the gaussian and spline kernels
overfit the data  as we get a very high training set accuracy but a much lower test set accuracy  so we suffer
from high variance  reducing the constant c improved performance somewhat  and taking outliers more
into account seemed to help  finally  increasing the grid granularity gave us poorer performance  we feel
one of the reasons is that increasing granularity would increase the number of entries in the feature vector 
and thus the amount of parameters in our hypothesis  which according to vapnik means we may have too
few training examples 
results 
our best accuracy here was with a linear kernel  c        and a    x    grid 
training set error               accuracy
test set error                 accuracy
classifier    skin cell layout  method  
this is the same method as above  with one important difference  intuitively  we thought that finer
grid granularity to a certain extent  would help in our skin based classification accuracy as we get more
information  but we were met with poor results  following our reasoning as to this cause from above  we no
longer have an entry for each cell in the svm input vector  but instead we aggregate the amount of skin cells
in all rows and columns of the grid   and use this aggregation data  thus  we hope to give the svm the same
relevant information  but with fewer entries in the feature vector  so that the amount of training examples we
have is enough  parameters and kernels were varied as above  with much the same observations  we
thought it useful to graph how the grid size affects the training and test errors  please see graph   in the
appendix  the graph is very close to those we saw in class  in learning theory 
results 
our reasoning seems correct and we see significant improvement here  with a linear kernel  c          and a
   x    grid 
training set error                accuracy
test set error                 accuracy
classifier    simple body part detection
we attempt to recognize certain body parts present in explicit images  this classifier is still in its
infancy  and currently recognizes only nipples  we trained the detector using small image cutouts of nipples
and control cutouts  grayscaling them  and running the pixels through an svm  the detector is then run on

fithe actual images to classify positives if nipples are found  we recognize that alone this classifier is not very
effective  but may be useful when combined with others 
results 
accuracy was low  but is as expected  since not all positive images have nipples and the classifier is still in
preliminary stages  we have no training set error for our actual images  as the classifier was trained on small
image cutouts  its training accuracy on those there was     
test set error                 accuracy
classifier    skin variations across edges
after going through many explicit images by hand  we observed that a common occurrence was
limbs and body parts of different people next to or over each other  recognizing such a feature could help
especially in images where skin detection may fail  please see figures      and   to see an example where
skin detection does not help due to clothes  but this new detector would catch such an image due to one
persons hand on the others naked shoulder  to achieve this  we locate edges and find whether there are
different skin hues on each side of the edge  if the difference is above a certain trained threshold  and there
are enough such occurrences in an image  we classify it as explicit  to achieve this we trained a detector on
image cutouts  much as we trained the body part detector above  and then we ran the resulting detector
within skin regions only  which boosted performance and accuracy  directly on the test set images 
for edge detection  we use the canny edge detector  and we run it only on areas labeled as skin to
boost speed and accuracy  please see figures   and   in the appendix to see edge detection at work being run
on the entire image as well as just within skin pixels 
results 
we obtain the best accuracy of any of our individual classifiers 
test set error                 accuracy
classifier    specific edge detection
this classifier is still a work in progress  we are trying to separate specific edges resulting from
edge detection  and learn which edges may indicate explicit images  once way to use this is building a
dictionary of representative edges found in pornography  and then treating edges in a similar fashion to how
words are treated in spam classification  a large challenge lies in separating edges and knowing where an
edge ends  and this is a challenge we are still working on 
combining weak classifiers
finally  we also attempted to combine some of our weak classifiers to see how they would fare
together  we combined classifiers      and    the current combination method works by assigning weights
to each individual classifier  and splitting the entire data into   segments  the first segment is used to train
the individual classifiers  and the second segment is used to train our weights with higher weights going to
classifiers that have smallest error  proportionally  the third set is for testing the final classifier  h  the
combination equation for our   classifiers is 
h             h              h              h 
               
where i is hypothesis his test error on the second data segment above 

firesults 
we achieved our best accuracy for the entire project here  but it is still a little less than we hoped for  we
suspect this is due to the fact that our body part classifier is still very weak and not a big help  and that the
other two features are too close  both being based on skin  however  we feel that combining features still has
great potential and is worth trying  especially after we complete new different classifiers such as classifier   
test set error                 accuracy
please note that  throughout these tests  our system always classified twice as many false positives as
false negatives  fairly consistently across the board 
   discussion and conclusions
please note  the discussion here is general  and conclusions and analysis to do with specific
classifiers are mainly written above under the method and result descriptions of that classifier 
overall  we found this a very challenging problem  as expected  however  we did manage to create
a system that worked  and delivers a fairly decent accuracy of         of course  we feel that this accuracy
still needs to improve  we found it was manageable to get to a reasonable accuracy of about      but as we
try to get to higher ones  the journey becomes what appears to be exponentially more difficult  the main
culprits here are outliers  images such as figure    where skin filtering does not help much  images where
there was no skin present but were still pornography  such as people wearing clothes  or images where there
was a good deal of skin but were innocuous  such as people at the beach  are what prevent high accuracy 
an additional observation worth noting is that our system classifies twice as many false positives as
negatives  so it is a stricter filter  we feel this is better for our purposes  such as preventing children from
seeing pornography  however  this view varies from person to person 
the framework we have built is far from a perfect classifier  but achieves the purpose of being a
great starting point for further improvements  as well as being a formidable classifier in its own right  we
have built it in such a modular way that new classifiers based on other features can easily be added to the
framework or taken away  which begs for future work as we elaborate below 
future directions 
our main hopes for the future are to build more classifiers based on other features or related sets of
features  and to test their different combinations  we feel we have almost exhausted skin related features 
these are very appropriate and useful  but we feel that now we need to look at other types  such as edges and
more sophisticated body part detection  these features would help in areas where skin detection fails such as
the outliers above  we would also like to find efficient ways of separating specific edges to build our edge
dictionary  in terms of body parts  we would like to learn more and better ways of detecting those body parts
that are found in explicit images  yet other features to explore are hair  specifically hair surrounded by skin 
new ways of combining our weaker classifiers are also on the agenda  we would like to try
boosting  for example  as it historically has done very well in such tasks  the traditional approach of
boosting with decision trees is also viable  as almost all our classifiers can be converted to decision trees 
we have a few more avenues to explore  our images have been hand labeled into categories  and we
could try specific filters for each category  such as for groups of people  people of very different skin colors 
etc  we would also like to get more data for our training  a current limitation  as we have to go through all
the images by hand  eventually  we aim to consider speed of our algorithms as well  we could also
combine our system with text and web page filtering currently used  which we are fairly certain would boost
our performance  finally  when we are done with sexually explicit images  we would like to consider other
offensive images such as violent ones to complete a truly general explicit image filter  one fit for the real
world
