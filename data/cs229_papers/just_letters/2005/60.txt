abstract
serre  wolf  and poggio introduced an object recognition algorithm that simulates image
processing in visual cortex and claimed to get better results than traditional recognition
methods  a close examination of their algorithm shows that it is based largely on
manually picked parameters  in this project  machine learning methods are applied to
modify the algorithm 
introduction
the way human vison system works has always been an interest to neuroscientists 
recently  computer scientists have become interested in modelling the human vison
systems as well  one of the motivations is to improve the understanding of  and possibly
to predict  how the brain functions   olshausen and field     demonstrated that receptive
fields of simple cells can be represented as basis functions that are similar to gabor filters 
and these basis functions can be learnt from images by sparse coding  a method that
maximizes information preservation and sparsity of response  this result is encouraging
because it agrees with observations that s  cells act like gabor filters 
another motivation is that humans still outperform the best machine vision systems on
tasks such as object recognition  it therefore makes sense to model computer vision
systems after the human vision system  serre  wolf  and poggio     introduced a set of
features that resemble the feedforward models of object recognition in v  and v  of the
visual cortex  the system deveoped using these features gives a higher recognition rate
compared to traditional template based and histogram based systems  however  the
algorithm relies heavily on parameters manually picked to fit biological cells  in addition 
s  and c  features are computed based on randomly selected c  prototypes  this method
is essentially template matching and does not seem to have a biological justification  the
objective of this project is to apply machine learning to the algorithm for feature
generation  and to develop a system that simulates the human vision system 
v  layer
in      s  receptive fields are modeled as gabor filters  parameters of these filters are
picked so that they agree with biological findings  and filters are grouped into eight bands
according to these parameters  s  cell responses are then obtained by applying these
filters to images and c  cell reponses are resulted from max pooling over scales and
positions 
although it has been proven that methods such as independent component analysis    
and sparse coding     can learn basis functions that resemble the gabor like s  receptive
fields  in order to generate c  cell responses  which are shift and scale invariant 
groupings of s  cells are necessary  independent subspace analysis  isa      is an
extension of ica that allows cells belonging to the same subspace to be dependent  more

fispecifically  cells within the same subspace have similar orientations and frequencies  but
may have slight variations in locations and very different phases  therefore  replacing the
the bands described in     by these subspaces and pooling the responses of cells within
same subspaces give phase and shift invariance  which are features of complex cells  in
addition  to get scale invariance  basis of different sizes can be grouped together
according to the similarity of their frequencies and spatial locations  which can be
estimated by fitting them to gabor filters  figure  a below shows the the bands of isa
filters formed using   by   and    by    basis  and figure  b shows the the basis fitted to
gabor filters

subspace size of    and   x   filters of subspace size  

topographical independent component analysis  tica      is another extension of ica
that allows some degree of dependence among components  in this implementation 
components are allowed to be dependent with their neighbors  similar to isa  these
neighbhorhoods can be used to replace the bands in     to obtain c  responses 
v  layer
in      s  response of an image is the distance between its c  response and the prototype
c  responses  which are chosen randomly at the beginning of the algorithm  a more
biologically related approach is to apply learning algorithms on c  responses to get s 
responses  figure   shows the v  filters obtained from applying sparse coding on isagenerated c  responses  this is a modification of the contour net algorithm in     
replacing the first layer with isa responses

experiments
two types of experiments were carried out to test the performance of the learned filters 
in the first experiment  six classes were chosen at random from caltech     with a
training sample size of                  and    respectively  as described in      each
category was tested against the background class in caltech      which consists of
random images downloaded from google  in the second experiment  each class was
tested against samples randomly chosen from the other five classes and the test was
repeated for ten times to get the average recognition rate 
table   below shows the two category classification results of replacing s  filters by  x 
isa filters  isa filters with scale invariance  by grouping filters of two different sizes
into the same band   fitted isa filters with scale invariance  and  x  tica filters
respectively  the last column shows the results using the original gabor filters of     for
comparison  it can be seen that the fitted isa filters with scale invariance give the closest
results with those obtained using the original gabor filters  although other filters give
results that are comparable as well

table   shows results of the second experiment when both layers are replaced by learned
filtersv  is replaced by isa filters and v  is replaced by sparse coding filters  since
sparse coding is not a linear algorithm  s  response cannot be computed by simply
convolving the filter with c  responses  c  responses have to be divided into smaller
patches in order to run gradient descent to get their s  responses  when dividing c 
responses into smaller patches  there could be overlapping areas between these patches 
table   shows the recognition rate of one versus five categories classification as the
overlap area varies  as shown  the results do not seem to be improved as one would
expect when increasing the proportion of overlap area

ficonclusion
comparable recognition rates are obtained by replacing the gabor filters in     by filters
learned from training on natural images  in particular  fitted isa filters with scale
invariance demostrate the best results  while tica filters give similar rates as isa filters 
it takes longer to compute because of the large number of bands and therefore are not
used in other experiments 
to actually improve the recognition rates and the efficiency of the algorithm  it is
expected that machine learning techniques have to be applied to the second layer as well 
preliminary results from applying sparse coding on c  reponses are not satisfactory 
possible changes that can be made include applying spatial pooling on the sparse coding
responses to increase shift invariance and to reduce the size of the feature vector fed into
the support vector machine  another possiblility is to apply isa or the independent
subspace version of sparse coding to c  reponses to give s  responses with groupings for
max pooling
