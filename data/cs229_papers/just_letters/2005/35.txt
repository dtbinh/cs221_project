introduction

existing air traffic control  atc  procedures rely completely on human supervision and control  however  with the burgeoning traffic demands  it has become necessary to find options for automated  and
possibly decentralized  traffic control  in particular  the problem of aircraft collision avoidance is of
great interest  however  current approaches           are either computationally intensive  or limited to a
two aircraft scenario  we draw inspiration from the two aircraft case and the trajectories generated by
gokhan et al and propose a relatively simple rule based scheme for collision avoidance  we call this a
traffic circle based method for   d collision avoidance  

 

preliminary issues

   

circle of minimum radius

we started with the idea of identifying a strategy for traffic circle formation  this involves deciding the
radius and position of the traffic circle  and a policy that aircraft follow to join and leave the traffic circle
to avoid collision    the natural choice for the radius was to choose the smallest possible value  with k
aircraft in a traffic circle  and minimum separation between aircraft rmin   we get the smallest radius of
the traffic circle to be  
rmin
   
rmin  
  sin  k 
where di is the distance traveled by ith aircraft  there are k points on the circle corresponding to k
aircraft and are assigned in order  aircrafts in particular sectors are assigned points in the same sector  
it is observed that the problem is convex in the coordinates of the center of circle 

   

clustering to form circles

there is still the bigger problem of deciding how the aircraft will join the circle without colliding  moreover  forming traffic circles for aircraft with arbitrary initial positions was found to lead to many pathological  highly suboptimal trajectories  therefore  a clustering algorithm was used to cluster aircraft
  aircraft
  current

involved in an impending collision form a traffic circle  along which they safely move and leave appropriately 
faa definition of a collision is a separation of less than   n mi horizontal and      ft  vertical

with similar headings together  with the idea that these aircraft will first form a line  and subsequently 
these lines lead to the traffic circle  this idea eventually blossomed into the ski lift approach described
in the next section  the clustering algorithm used was k means  and the features used were simply the
nominal headings of the aircraft 

 

the ski lifts approach

the basic idea of the traffic circle is the following  if the aircraft involved in a collision can form a safe
circle that they traverse tangentially  they can then leave the circle at any time and continue on to their
original destinations  however  for this to hold  it means that we cannot have a sector of more than    
degrees handled by a single traffic circle  this is because further collisions will be caused as the aircraft
leave the circle  therefore  we impose the restriction that at any given altitude  the   d problem that
we address   all aircraft have velocities in a particular     degree sector  then  if aircraft get onto the
traffic circle  they are assured to be safe as long as they leave the traffic circle in one of the other two
sectors  this is similar to the safe trajectory generated for the two aircraft case in      moreover  to avoid
large changes of direction when aircraft join the circle  we further stipulate that there are predetermined
lines that lead into this traffic circle  and that there are preset moving points along these lines which are
guaranteed to be safe on the circle also  we can think of this as being similar to chairs on a ski lift  as
long as the aircraft get on a chair without colliding with other aircraft  they are safe as long as they
are on the ski lift 
the problem can be been reduced to the following  given an assignment of aircraft to a particular
chair on a ski lift  generate a trajectory that has no collisions with other aircraft assigned to the same ski
lift  this way  a potentially large problem involving many aircraft is reduced to a much smaller problem
involving only those aircraft assigned a ski lift  at the moment  assignment of aircraft to specific chairs
on the ski lifts was done heuristically  then  reinforcement learning was implemented to learn a strategy
for capturing the ski lift in a collision free manner 

   

reinforcement learning

our rl problem for each ski lift has a continuous state space x  whose components x    y    x            xn   yn
denote cartesian coordinates of all aircraft assigned that lift  relative to their assigned chairs  without
loss of generality  the lift is assumed to be moving along the positive x direction with speed vt   time
was discretized  and over each time segment  all aircraft were assumed to move at fixed speed  they
choose heading angles in steps of    degrees  while not on the lift  they have a velocity va       vt  in
k
order that they can catch up with a moving lift   and a heading       
   k                  the velocity
of the aircraft in the lift fixed coordinate system is given by
vrel     va cos    vt   va sin   t

   

finally  the approach is decentralized  in that the actions only refer to the headings of one aircraft  the
following reward structure was used

value iteration was used to find the value function 

   

value iteration  one or two aircraft

with only one or two aircraft  the state space is a compact subset of r  or r    and the action space is
a small number of discrete values  the value function is a function on a fairly small  albeit continuous
space  therefore  we resorted to gridding  however  to query the value function at any continuous
state x  we used interpolation with the matlab function interpn  a version of locally weighted linear
regression was also implemented in matlab   but in spite of using vectorized code  was much slower than
the built in interpolation  a plot of the value function for a one aircraft and one opponent is shown in
figure     

   

value iteration  three aircraft case

with two or more opponents  the state space is now at least   dimensional  this proved too large for
naive gridding  therefore  we attempted to fit a polynomial to the value function  as shown in figure
    using a matlab toolbox soscode      we were able to generate polynomials of arbitrary degree in
  dimensions  we generated polynomials of degree less than    note that a degree   polynomial in  
variables has upto     monomials  however  we found that although the value function passed through
specified points  like  e  at the target   the process of value iteration based on this polynomial fit did not
converge  therefore  we used the following heuristic to compute an approximate value function  for
any position of a single opponent  we have the   dimensional value function from the interpolated grid

the value function by the average of the values corresponding to each of the single opponents separately

decentralized optimal policy for   aircraft  split into three ski lifts of three aircraft each 

 

future work

a major drawback of our approach is that dynamics of the aircraft were neglected  still  the time and
space scales of the collision avoidance problem are so large that many details of the dynamics are truly
negligible  for instance  one unit on the plots shown symbolizes the rather large distance of   nautical
miles   the one aspect that is meaningful to include is the fact that though aircraft can be assumed
to change turn rate instantaneously  they cannot be assumed to change heading instantaneously  this
increases the dimension of our state space by one   for each time interval  the aircraft can choose a
finite heading chage  in a certain allowable change   becomes a state variable that is not controlled
explicitly 
with increased memory  it should be possible to attack parametrized models like the polynomial
model described earlier  however  it might be necessary to go to higher order polynomials
