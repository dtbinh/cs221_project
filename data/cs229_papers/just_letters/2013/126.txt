introduction

each individual has his her personal driving behavior  which could been used as
a identifying characteristic  similar to handwriting  under this hypothesis  we
propose a learning study of the connection between a drivers identity and the
vehicles characteristics  such as accelerometer heading speed  which can usually be collected using the electronic system of the vehicle or by imposing other
measurements  the dataset includes real time high frequency accelerometer 
heading  speed  odometer  and gas usage  we first convert the time dependent
data into a large number of time independent features  which can then be used
to train vehicle against vehicle classifiers  we aim to obtain the reliable supervised learning algorithm for the single driver driving the same car  as well as
unsupervised clustering to detect when vehicles have multiple drivers 

 

data collecting

the data collection was operated by metromile  inc and has been saved in
csv  comma separated values  format which can be seen and manipulated by
microsoft excel and matlab  each csv file has the information for one car 
in which the data was collected for a number of trips  each trip includes the
information for a continuous section of time  usually every second or every
few seconds  the recorded information includes the velocity in the units of
mph  the orientation of the car  the accelerations in three dimensions  and the
transient gas usage  see figure   for the first trip that has been collected for
car             the characteristic number of trips collected at each car is a
few thousands  which is for example      for car            when any two
consecutive data points collected with a time interval greater than    seconds
being seen as two different trips  this provides us a lot of information to study
the driving behavior of each driver  and further with the assumption that
driving behavior is unique for each single person  we can identify the driver just
by looking at the way he she drives  we note that the we assume that the each
drivers driving behavior is independent of the cars make model condition  just
 

filike when people recognize the signature the kind of pen he she uses is ignored 
the same data collecting procedure has been performed for    different cars 
we know from the data provider that some of the cars are driven by one single
drive  while some of the cars are driven by multiple people in a family  table

feature selection

extracting out the key features from the tons of data that we have obtained is
one of the key questions for this study  we see each trip as one data point  so
that we can extract a vector x containing all the useful features to represent this
data point  then we can obtain  for example for car            data points 
this has provided us a large enough data set for either the regression for the
single driver cases or the multi class classification for the multiple drivers cases 
to find out the good and useful features turn out to be a tough question 
especially considering the complexity of the collected data and the problem itself  the features that we propose include      average speed in each section
x      max speed in each section x      average speed on the ramp when entering highway x      average speed on the ramp when leaving highway x     
frequency of lane changing x      speed at   second before stop x      speed
at   second before stop x      speed at   second before stop x      speed at
  second after start x       speed at   second after start x         speed at  
second after start x     x   x    x    x    x    x    x    x    x    x    x     x    t   we find

out that by including these features we dont oversimply the modeling nor make
the modeling over complicated so as to overfit 

 

supervised learning

we performed supervised learning for the car of single driver  the internal relation of the features can be modeled as  x   n  a  x    a  x   a    a  x   a    
x   n  a    a     x   n  a    a     x   n  a     a      x   n  a    x    a     a   
x   a      x   n  a   x   a     a   x   a      x   n  a   x    a     a   x    
a      x    n  a    x     a     a    x     a      for the cars of one single driver 
we fit the features with the model described above and find the parameter a 
 a    a    a    a    a    a    a    a    a    a     a     a     a     a     a     a     a     a     a     a     a    
a     a     a     a     a     a    t   the parameter vector a can be used to as the identification for the driver  a model fitting of the features for car            has
been shown in figure   

 

unsupervised learning

for those cars of multiple drivers  we use k means clustering algorithm to separate different drivers  for example  for car            as shown in figure    the
frequency of lane changing highlighted by the dotted circles have two clusters
that can be directly used to separate the two drivers  this algorithm becomes
very useful for separating the drivers who have very different behaviors on lane
changing frequency  but may not work very well when different drives tend to
have close behaviors on lane changing frequency
