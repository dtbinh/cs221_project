   introduction

   data

given the information the young president has been travelling for eight weeks  we can correctly conclude that
the president has been travelling for eight weeks however  if it is known that the former president has been
travelling for eight weeks  it would be incorrect to conclude that the president has been travelling for eight
weeks  since the former president is not the president  as
is obvious to a native english speaker  the adjective former somehow modifies the noun president such that
we conclude that it no longer belongs to the set of things
that are presidents by virtue of being former  linguists
categorize adjectives with this effect as being intensional 
distinguishing between intensional and extensional  nonintensional  adjectives is an important part of understanding textual entailment  essential to the domain of natural
language understanding     

the three data sets we extracted for this report all derive
from dumps of english wikipedia articles  one database
which had undergone tokenization  part of speech tagging
and sentence splitting  carried out by the nlp group at
stanford  was used for adjective noun co occurrences  in
total    gb of uncompressed text was used  covering
     different types of adjective          unique         
types of noun          unique  and total co occurrences of
            the other database had dependency and token
contexts annotated  this allowed adverbs       unique 
modifying adjectives       unique  to be extracted for a
total of         co occurrences  finally         adjectivenoun pairs were extracted with         different contexts 
for a total of            co occurrences 

related work
in boleda et al      the distributional representations of
various intensional and extensional adjectives were examined different composition functions were used to model
adjectival modification  and the predicted properties of the
compositional representations were evaluated  intensional
adjective noun vectors were most similar to those of the
unmodified noun using cosine similarity  boleda et al    
conducted an extension to their earlier work  using an enhanced list of intensional adjectives  as well as a more varied set of extensional adjectives  both concluded that modification by intensional and extensional adjectives were both
modelled equivalently well with existing composition functions 
this work
this final project for cs   n and cs     will attempt to
classify whether an unseen adjective is intensional based
on a linguistic model and to expand the list of intensional
adjectives known in the literature  it increases the number of known intensional adjectives by       it does this
using adjective noun co occurrences  section    and grammatical and contextual information  section    and the machinery of support vector machines  adverbs associated
with adjectives were also considered  but the results were
uninformative 

the list of known intensional adjectives  see appendix a 
was curated by reading the literature      and expanded by
adding synonyms as well as false positives found during
early testing of the classifier   

   methods
labelled data this problem is a supervised learning
classification problem  the prior knowledge of only   
known intensional adjectives had the following repercussions 
incorrect example labels all other adjectives were assumed
 incorrectly  to be extensional  this affected classification
as was seen by relabelling discovered intensional adjectives
in the training set 
train test division we chose to split the known intensional
adjectives into a set of    for testing and a set of    for
testing  up to      and      extensional adjectives were
added to these  learning algorithms were applied using
stratified k fold cross validation to maintain the ratio of
positive negative examples 
classifier a linear support vector machine  svm  was
used        to classify the tokens as being either intensional
or extensional  input data was scaled to have zero mean
and unit variance  which increased precision and recall and
sped up the algorithm  the penalty for errors for each class
was set to be inversely proportional to their frequency in
  examples found by early classifiers were strictly restricted to
the training set in the classifiers used for evaluation 

fiintensionality of adjectives

the training data  earlier in the project naive bayes and
logistic regression models were also used  but they did
not work as well 
features co occurrences are frequencies  which do not
adequately represent the significance of a particular cooccurrence  we applied some standard transformations
 lmi  pmi  pmi    to the data before classification  with the
objective of filtering out less meaningful co occurrences 
the following transformation was used 
pmi   a  n    log 

pr a  n  
 
pr a   pr n 

feature selection to minimize the effect of over fitting
with too many features and to provide a meaningful subset
of features for understanding how intensional adjectives are
use  the following methods  we first used a thresholding
scheme to select nouns who co occured with some at least
some number of intensional adjectives  this proved better
than using only frequency of co occurence  but was not as
effective as using differential expression 
differential expression another approach to categorising and building models that predict the class of adjective
has been to appropriate techniques used in bioinformatics to find nouns  genes  that are called differentially expressed between different adjectives  tissues samples     
briefly  it works by performing statistical tests between
different classes for a given feature  taking into account
the variance both within and between classes to measure
the likelihood that a feature is expressed higher or lower
 p value       after benjamini hochberg corrections for
multiple testing      the other method is to sort features by
their log fold change  that is  after suitable normalizations  how much are they expressed in one class compared
to another  it was observed that picking features using the
log fold change method performed best 
in an attempt to improve the list of features again  an automatic recursive feature elimination with cross validation
algorithm was also employed to minimize the set  using the
f

can modify  using adjective noun bigrams  we constructed

a vector space of adjectives  using their co occurrence frequencies  above a threshold  with nouns as features 
the best results were achieved by using nouns  features 
chosen by log fold change as determined by differential
expression and counts modified by pmi    using the recursive feature elimination with cross validation increased
the number of false positives and false negatives  so was
not used 
we updated the training set by incorporating false positive
adjectives that turned out to be mislabelled to attempt to
better train the learning algorithm

     analysis
false negatives polysemous adjectives with extensional
meanings but labelled intensional in our data were frequently mislabelled  for example  this occurred with theoretical  which often modifies physics  and artificial
 which often modifies intelligence and insemination  
adjectives such as likely and probable   with exactly
one meaning  which is intensional   tended to fare better 
and were classified as extensional less frequently  our classifiers also misclassified phony and erstwhile as extensional  which may be due to the lack of data  stemming
from their low frequencies 
false positives manually sifting through the false positives revealed many intensional adjectives that we had not
considered in our seed list  two conclusions can be drawn
from this  first  the accuracy of our system may be higher
than the confusion matrices show  second  our system recovers intensional adjectives at a rate higher than chance 
some examples include   historic  faulty  uncertain  plausible  erroneous  illegitimate  simulated 
polysemous words certain adjectives in our seed set
which were labelled as intensional were actually only intensional when used in a certain sense  for example  assumed culprit may not actually be a culprit  but an assumed
name is  in fact  a name  this led us to the inference that
intensionality is the characteristic of a particular instance
of adjectival modification  and informed the classifiers in
  
idioms and common collocations while the word potential in the context of potential solution is intensional 
potential occurs most commonly in the corpus as part of
the collocation potential energy  which is  in fact  subsective  also  the idioms such as false alarm occur with high
frequencies and are not examples of intensional modification  this is further justification for instance based classification 

fiintensionality of adjectives

antonyms many antonyms of privative adjectives were
wrongly classified as intensional  these are adjectives that
affirm the membership of a noun to its class  and appear in
similar context to privative adjectives  it was not expected
that instance based classification could correctly classify
these instances  since the ambiguity was inherent in the
contexts  however  it was worth noting that these adjectives might cause persistent errors  some examples include  true  complete  obvious  factual 

   instance based classification
method
we modified our hypothesis  claiming that intensionality is
a characteristic of particular instances of adjectival modification  in the instance based classifier  each example corresponds to an adjective noun pair  one advantage of this
model was that we were no longer restricted to a maximum
of    positive examples  since a positive example could be
constructed out of any occurrence of an intensional adjective  for each adjective in the training and test sets  we
selected five distinct nouns most frequently modified by it 
all adjective noun pairs in which the adjective was usually
intensional were labelled as intensional  although this contradicts the idea behind instance based classification  we
hoped to find reliable false positives that would allow bootstrapping  which would address this problem 
we hypothesised that since a noun n modified by an intensional adjective is no longer an n  the contexts in which
the modified and unmodified noun occur would be distinct 
for every pair of modified noun and context  a n  y  that
co occurred in the corpus  we calculated
f  a n  y   

pr y   a n 
 
pr y   unmodified n 

using add one smoothing for the probabilities of the unmodified contexts  since is it possible that they might be
zero   this can be expressed as
f  a n  y   

c y  a n    c unmodified n     y   
 
c a n   c unmodified n  y 

where c is a counting function  we also calculated 

considered the top      context features after weighting
with pmi    we also modified the experiment to include a
threshold for the number of times a context must co occur
with a noun or adjective noun instance to be considered 
results
the instance based classifiers performed very poorly 
achieving accuracy below the majority baseline for all ratios of mextensional   mintensional   without further investigation  this could be due to the assumption made about our
training data  that if the adjective is marked as intensional
then the adjective noun pair is as well  a more nuanced
training set may improve the results and reduce the large
number of false positives and negatives we receive  results for a representative subset of classifiers are shown in

table    results for instance based classification 

analysis
the frequency distribution of the contexts observed was
similar to that predicted by zipfs law  the patterns that
occurred with high frequencies were relatively uninformative  frequencies then dropped off sharply  resulting in
high data sparsity  this could be amended by using generalisations  in the noun co occurrence experiments  we
used transformations to ensure that more meaningful cooccurrences were given a higher weight  a more effective
measure by which to weight pair context co occurrences
would contribute to more effective feature selection 

   evaluation

the experiments were conducted using token based contexts  with a window of up to two tokens on either side of
the target 

as only the adjective noun co occurrence classifier performed reasonably and features from the other classifiers
were uninformative  we chose to use only the adjectivenoun co occurrence data in our final training set  the linear
svm was trained against all the training data using the appropriate number of features as found maximized the number of correct predictions in the training set 

to reduce the number of features used by the classifier 
we considered only the top      context features by frequency  since these were not always informative  we also

these confusion matrices show that we often only identify
    of the intensional adjectives in the test set  increasing the number of features we trained upon increases this

percentage for the lower extensional intensional ratio samples  indicating that it may just be doing an improved job
at classifying those adjectives as being intensional against
the particular extensional adjectives  rather than the class
of all of them 
further work could divide the intensional adjectives into a
few subclasses based on their semantic properties  for example  separating privative and plain non subsective adjectives  and try to train on each of those  this would hopefully better capture the variety of ways different classes of
adjectives are used  although the instance based features
did not work well here  finding a good choice and training
with appropriately labelled training data  data that does not
assume every instance of an intensional adjective is used in
an intensional manner  still feels like it may be useful 
even though we were not highly successful in classifying
unseen adjectives  we did manage to increase the number
of known intensional adjectives by      

acknowledgments
we would like to thank gabor angeli for the original
project idea of detecting intensionality and for the numerous discussions we had with him during the course of this
project  he was always good to bounce ideas off of and
also provided us with some of the scripts needed to extract
the data from the corpora
