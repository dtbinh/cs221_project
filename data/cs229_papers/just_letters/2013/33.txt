identifying gas savings from driver behavior
arthur lacoste  marie pellat  thomas piani
abstract  this project aimed to identify
potential gas savings in a drivers behavior and
suggest changes  the steps we took were
threefold  we first built a model predicting
instantaneous gas consumption from driving
data  then extracted driving constraints
 trajectory  min   max speed  turns  stops   and
finally we devised a working technique to
minimize fuel consumption under these
constraints  using machine learning techniques
and physics insights  we managed to predict
instantaneous gas consumption with very good
accuracy  r  around      using only   distinct
features in a linear model based on noisy and
limited driving data  our optimization technique
provided applicable driving patterns that
drastically reduced gas consumption  by    to
     while following driving constraints

introduction

americans spend around      billion on gas every
year  an astounding number that keeps growing with
gas prices  gas consumption  however  is not
equally shared between drivers  indeed  it is
common knowledge that driving habits can impact
gas consumption  and that two driving patterns on
the same route can lead to very different fuel
consumptions  directly impacting the cost for
drivers  but devising a good driving behavior over
the course of an entire trip is a tough problem that
requires linking driving data to fuel consumption
and providing solutions that are feasible in real life 
to tackle this issue  we used datasets of driving data
that were provided by metromile  a company that
seeks to make use of driving data to save drivers
time and money  their first offering is a per mile car
insurance that charges drivers based on actual miles
driven  for this project  the company gave us access
to the driving data  speed  accelerations  heading and
instantaneous gas consumption  from    employee
cars collected using an embarked device 

ii  data preprocessing
   change of referential
the device measuring accelerations is fixed in the
car but its orientation in unknown and a first step is
to determine the corresponding referential change
matrix  the vertical direction is easily identified as
the average of all accelerations  gravity being a very
strong signal  we used two different methods to
determine the x and y axes 

first method  we isolated sections of the trajectory
where the heading remains steady and the vehicle is
speeding up or slowing down significantly  in these
situations  the acceleration should be on the x axis 
second method  we computed theoretical axial and
lateral accelerations based on the vehicles speed 
speed variation and heading variations  we then ran
a modified version of ordinary least squares to
determine the x and y axes for which the measured
accelerations would best fit the theoretical ones   see
milestone for the closed form solution 
   dealing with gaps in the data
our datasets have time gaps  long gaps separate
different trips and short ones are just missing
measures  we decided to fill in gaps under   
seconds  linearly between the two extreme data
points  and regard bigger gaps as a separation
between two independent trips 
   objective function
the consumption measurement in the datasets is in
miles per gallon  but we though the instantaneous
consumption  in gallons per unit of time  would be
much easier to predict  in addition  as that quantity
showed high frequency variations that did not exist
in the rest of the data  we smoothed it over a  
second window  which has no impact on total fuel
consumption  

iii  instantaneous consumption predictor
   initial features and algorithm
we used an ordinary least squares regression as our
learning algorithm       training data      testing
data   and the r coefficient as our performance
measurement to avoid acute sensitivity to the
smoothing of the gas consumption and to easily
measure the relevance of a feature  we first tried to
guess relevant features through physic intuition 
  speed   laminar friction losses 
      turbulent friction losses 
  acceleration 
      energy variation from speed or
elevation variation 
in addition  we added features corresponding to the
past and future values of these quantities over a    s
to    s window  for a resulting r        train  
test   trying out different combinations of these
features  we realized that speed  whether  or     
and energy variation were the most important
factors  and indeed we reached the same
performance of r       using only  and     

firand lms with different polynomial models
 replacing the indicator features  and all of them fit
   decently  however  the            and
         models both sometimes  depending
on the dataset  show negative weights  respectively
for    and for     which does not make physical
sense  a negative weight for  means that you
consume less fuel per unit of time driving slowly
than not moving at all   therefore  we decided to
only retain the very significant    term and settled
on the model              
figure    learned weights of        blue  and
            green  as a function of 

   categorization
with no sign of overfitting and in order to further
improve our models performance  we introduced a
categorization of the data in different speed    mph
  less     to    mph     to    mph     mph and
more  and acceleration  speeding up  cruising 
slowing down  regimes  we fitted a different model
for each tuple of speed and acceleration regime  this
improved r up to      on some datasets   but
introduces discontinuities in the instantaneous
consumption prediction which result in aberrant
optimal driving behaviour  therefore  we went back
to an uncategorized model 
   physics based model
a  insight
we had identified that energy variation was a key
feature to predict gas consumption  but realized that
using    meant we treated positive and negative
energy variations in the same way  which did not
make much physical sense  indeed  any energy gain
directly translates into a cost in gas  but not all
energy losses do  for instance  when braking hard  
we decided to incorporate this by using only the
positive part of energy variation in our linear
regression                in addition 
physical intuition and our previous results both
suggest to also use a term depending only on   
    that would represent the baseline consumption
when the car maintains speed  
b  choosing   
since we were not sure of what type of function to
choose for     we decided to discretize our data
with respect to speed to get the value of    at
different speeds  in practice  we used lms for our
whole dataset with the features      and
         with       mph and         
buckets  the plotted curve  figure    of the weights
of the indicator features deliver     for which a
polynomial would be a good approximation  we

c  model and results
our model is                  
where  is the gas consumption just from the engine
running     is the fuel cost to compensate losses at
speed  and      is the fuel cost of increasing
the cars kinetic or potential energy  we originally
added all     s    s  values of      but the
weights fitted proved that not all of them actually
matter  indeed  we were able to reach almost the
same performance of r       using only the
average of      over a    s   s  time window
where the weights were the highest  we believe
there are two reasons for this spread 
  measurements of ax are very noisy  and
smoothing  would probably have been a
valid approach too 
  the objective function itself is smoothed
over    s   s   which ties the consumption
at time  to that of neighboring points  we
confirmed that increasing the smoothing
window for the instantaneous gas
consumption increases that spread

   model improvement
a  insight
our previous model makes the assumption that there
is no way to transform negative energy variations
into gas savings  which is not entirely true  indeed 
braking wastefully dissipates energy  but inevitable
losses  the    term  can be compensated either by
fuel input or by an energy decrease  thus it is
possible to save up to    instantaneous fuel usage
from negative energy variations  but no more  the
idling consumption  cannot be negated   this
yields the following model 
                
                     
b  training strategy
this type of model cannot be directly fitted using
lms because some parameters are inside the
positive part  instead  we used the following training
strategy 
fit      using              to get
initial        values
repeat until convergence 
set                    
fit   using             
update                        
c  results
this model yielded slightly better results than the
first model r        but has the added advantage
of more realistically handling energy decrease
phases  using both models  we plotted the
consumption in miles per gallon to maintain the car


at speed      
      


figure    mpg speed  for the two trained models

figure   shows there is an optimal speed   at which
fuel efficiency is maximal  so that the optimal
unconstrained driving behavior over a long enough
trip will be to cruise at speed     the fuel
efficiencies predicted by both models are
significantly different for the following reason 
under the no savings model  consumption in energy
decrease phases are overestimated  which lms
partially compensates by fitting lower values for 
and   resulting in abnormally high fuel efficiencies 

iv  driving behavior optimization
   general methodology
given driving data  our end goal is to provide gassaving driving behavior suggestions  using a simple
physics model  we can reconstruct the drivers
trajectory from that data as well as generate
simulated driving data for any speed profile over
that trajectory  we can then feed that simulated
driving data to our trained instantaneous
consumption predictor to estimate the total
consumption 
   trajectory reconstruction
the most important constraint for an optimal driving
pattern is that it follows the same trajectory as the
original data  we used the following equations to
reconstruct        for every data point 

sin          

          cos    cos  
          cos    sin  
          sin  
where  is the slope of the trajectory and  is the
heading of the car  included in the data  
since our axial acceleration data  is very noisy 
the estimates for sin   vary significantly and fast 
in order for the reconstructed trajectory to be
realistic  we smoothed them over a large time

b  point by point optimization
 under the assumption that the stopping time is although our final model for instantaneous
unpredictable   but is plain wrong for traffic jam consumption uses the averaged energy variation  it is
situations 
reasonable  when only trying to predict the overall
consumption  to scale the  coefficient and use the
in reality there are additional constraints that we are instantaneous energy variation instead 
unable to infer from the driving behavior  for
 

example another car slowing down forcing you to
 
         
 
  
slow down as well 
  

  

   optimization techniques
ideally  we would like to find the optimal  with
regard to consumption  speed profile satisfying the
constraints  however this is a complex and nonconvex optimization problem  a linear combination
of valid speed profiles is not guaranteed to be valid  
so we tackled it with approximation techniques 


    

                

  

 


                
   

 

with       
then  modelling the speed as linear between two
discretization points  we can express the total
consumption between two points of respective
speeds   and   separated by a distance  with
slope

fithis allows to optimize the total consumption pointby point  coordinate descent  by fixating the speeds
of neighbour points and taking 
   arg min            
             
this technique is much more efficient efficient  and
could be adapted to work with any instantaneous
consumption model  it would require to simulate
driving data locally around each point to optimize
instead of just evaluating an integral  
   results and limitations
figure   shows the results of the point by point
optimization technique applied to a real trip in one
of our datasets  on this example  the optimization
improves the overall fuel efficiency for the trip from
      mpg up to       mpg  an increase of       
this demonstrates there are indeed important

savings to be made by improving driving behavior 
however  there is no guarantee on the optimality of
the solution the algorithm converges to  the problem
is not convex  
for example  point by point optimization handles
stopping points strangely  it always prefers cruising
at speed   and instantly slowing down to speed
zero  or saturating the deceleration constraint  when
reaching the stopping point  by doing so  it wastes
all of its kinetic energy instead of slowing down
over time to convert it into fuel savings  although
the optimal solution of this stopping problem under
the consumption model             
    is not easy to determine  we proved that
cruising at speed   and instantly stopping is
suboptimal  we are still not certain what the reason
for that strange behaviour is  the cruise and stop
profile being a local optimum of that problem or
discretization modifying the problem  and its
optimum  in a subtle way

constraints          
         


v  conclusion
using fairly limited and noisy driving data  we
managed to build a gas consumption predictor that
achieved very high accuracy  r  around      using
a linear structure and only   different features  we
were able to extract trajectory and constraints from
the driving data and  using our optimization strategy 
to devise optimized driving patterns that would be
feasible in a real setting and would yield important
gas savings  it is interesting to note that throughout
this project  we consistently achieved the best results
when we managed to incorporate physics insights

about the problem in machine learning strategies 
this is an example of the importance of human
intelligence and guidance in the success of
computer assisted techniques
