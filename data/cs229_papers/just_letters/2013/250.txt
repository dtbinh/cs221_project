abstract
in this project  we perform an integrative analysis of    kinds of anti cancer drug
response on around     cancer patients  first  we use lasso to build a prediction system for each individual drug response  then a graph lasso is employed
to utilize the correlation between multiple tasks in order to build a more robust
prediction system  finally  we further perform supervised and unsupervised categorization of patients into multiple cancer types  our analysis shows gene expression is most discriminative and useful in cancer categorization and drug response
prediction 

 

introduction

human cancer cell lines contain valuable information with respect to tumour biology and drug discovery  annotated with both genetic and pharmacological data  cell line panels are widely used to
address the problem of a tumour lineage or across multiple cancer types  however  these studies
are limited in their depth of genetic characterization and pharmacological interrogation  recently  a
large scale genomic dataset has been generated to facilitate the research of finding key genetic variations that have the highest correlation or casualty with anti cancer drug response to multiple complex
cancers  the goal of our project is to develop a novel machine learning algorithm that is capable of
detecting the relevant genetic variations that can well predict the drug response to multiple cancer
types 
we formulate this problem as a multi view multi task sparse regression problems  given multiple
data types  and multiple outputs  we want to apply a sparse version of regression model that can
automatically detect the important factors in the data  different from traditional regression model
that assume equal correlation between multiple outputs and inputs  we need to address the structural
correlation between multiple genetic data and various drug reponses  in this project  we propose a
novel framework that can make use of the structural informations with the constraints of sparsity 
the contributions are at least two fold     we formulate the drug response regression problems in
a multi view multi task sparse regression model  this model can well characterize the correlation
between genetic data and anti cancer drug response     we consider the structures information in
the sparse coefficient spaces and therefore can well capture the high order biological interaction
between genotypes and phenotypes 

 
   

regression prediction of drug efficacy
method

what we are considering is a multi task regression problem  previous methods such as l    regularized
multi task regression assume that all of the output variables are equally related to the inputs  but in
 

fithe drug efficacy analysis problem  the drugs are likely to affect similar groups of genes  it is
reasonable to believe that closely related outputs  pharmarcological characterization of the drugs 
tend to share a common set of relevant inputs  genomic characterization of each genes   so instead
of using normal lasso method  we use graph guided lasso which introduce a fusion penalty in order
to identify shared relevant covariates for related output variables 
given sample of n instances  each represented as a j dimensional input vector and k dimensional
output vector  let x    x    x            xn    rn j   let y    y    y            yk    rn k represent
the output matrix  for each of the k output variables  the usual linear model is as follows 
yk   xk   k
where k     k    k           jk    rj is the vector of regression coefficients for the k th output
variable and k is a vector of n independent zero mean gaussian noise 
let b                    k   denote the j  k matrix of regression coefficients  then a traditional
b lasso by solving the following optimization problems 
lasso obtains b
b lasso   arg min   ky  xbk    kbk 
b
f
b  
where k  kf means the matrix frobenius norm  k  k  denotes the entry wise matrix l  norm  and 
is a regularization parameters that controls the sparsity level 
one problem with lasso is the implicit assumption that  each task is independent of each other  this
assumption is not true in our data because most of anti cancer drug can be highly related because
they target a subset of same cancer related genes  we show the correlations between drug responses
in fig    b    high correlations are observed between the    drug response  to better utilize these
correlations  we employs a novel multi task prediction method  gflasso     
gflasso takes into account the complex dependency structure in the output variables represented as a
graph when estimating the regression coefficients  the graph g has a set of nodes v               k 
and edges e  the graph is constructed by computing pairwise pearson correlation based on yk s
and two nodes ym and yl are connected with an edge if their pearson correlation rml is above a
given threshold  
given the graph g  gflasso introduses an additional constraint over the standard lasso by fusing the
jm and jl if  m  l   e as follows 
b gf   arg min   ky  xbk    kbk    
b
f
b  

x
 m l e

 rml  

j
x

 jm  sign rml  jl  

j  

where  is a regularization parameters that denotes fusion penalty magnitude  outputs that have a
stronger correlation would receive higher fusion effect because they have larger krml k  the overall
effect is that each subset of output variables with a stronger correlation tend to have common relevant
covariates 
for optimization of the gflasso  we use the proximal gradient method    
   

data

we utilize the gene expression  gene copy number  and gene mutation value data taken from    
patients with different types of cancer  and get dose response data for the    types of drugs  the
distribution of different cancer is shown in fig    a   
     

genomic characterization

gene expression mrna expression data was obtained using affymetrix human genome u   
plus     arrays  genecentric expression values were objtained using updated affymetrix probe set
definition files from brainarray    and background correction was accomplished using rma    and
quantile normalization

gene copy number the raw cel files were normalized to copy number estimates using a
genepattern pipeline    and hg   affymetrix probe annotations  normalized copy number estimates were segmented using the circular binary segmentation algorithm  followed by median centering of the segment values to a value of zero in each sample 
gene mutation values mutation data was generated for specific cancer gene loci using the mass
spectrometric genotyping based oncomap platform and data analysis was performed as previously
described    
     

pharmacological characterization

all dose response data was fitted to one of three models depending on the statistical quality of the
fits measured using a chi squared test  one approach was the   parameter sigmoid model 
hill
y   ainf   a  ainf

ec  

alternatively  a constant model y   ainf was employed or a non parametric spline interpolation of
the data points was performed  in these models  a  and ainf are the top and bottom asymptotes of
the response  ec   is the inflection point of the curve  and hill is the hill slope  key parameters
derived from the models include ic   and activity area  ic   is the concentration where the fitted
curve crosses     the activity area is calculated as the sum of differences between the measured
ai at concentration i and the reference level 
   

prediction of drug response

we have n       cell line samples  represented as a j dimensional input vector and k dimensional
output vector  where j equals to              and      respectively for gene expression  copy
number variation and gene mutation value  and k      for    types of drugs  the correlation map
is generated for the    drugs  we can see that some of the drugs are strongly correlated 
we use     of the cell line sample for training and the rest     for testing  using the aforementioned
gflasso method on the three features gene expression  copy number variation and gene mutation
value separately and collectively  we generate regression coefficients with different choices of values
for the regularization parameter    and then compared the root mean squared error of prediction
on the testing sample  we find that     gene expression would have a better estimation than the
other features  making it most useful for cancer categoriztion     with a higher value of   gene
expression prediction would have a smaller rms error  which implies that the by considering the
correlation between different drug outputs  we would have a better estimation of drug response 
with      and       we would achieve the best estimation of drug response

cancer categorization

we want to find the most discriminative type of genomic data  as a result  we implement classification for cancer types using ge  cnv and gm  respectively  the most discriminative type of
features should give us the highest accuracy    methods were implemented    fold supervised svm
using liblinear     unsupervised k means clustering    and spectral clustering     considering
the high skewness of the cancer types  some cancers have only one patient  while other cancers have
more than    patients   we only choose the cancers with more than    patients  the results can be
seen from fig     

figure    cancer categorization
from our results  we can see that for all   methods  ge gives us the highest accuracy  which means
it is the most discriminative feature  this can be explained as below  typically  a certain type of
cancer is only related to a small number of gene mutations  for cnv and gm  only the few features
relate to the few genes that mutate will be different for different types of cancers  while the rest
of thousands of features are identical  therefore  to use ge and cnv  we need to pre select the
effective genes out  however  this is still an open question  therefore  using cnv and gm as
features may not be effective  in contrast  although only a few genes mutate for a certain kind of
cancer  however  all of the gene expression will be changed correspondingly  therefore  ge is
highly discriminative 
 

fiwhats more  we test the effect of concatenation of all   types of features  ge  cnv and gm   from
fig      we can see that concatenation is worse the ge alone  that is because concatenation will
diminish some correlation information  which is very important for our case  also  concatenation
will augment the noise  as a result  it is better for us to use gene expression alone 

 

conclusion

in this project  we performed an integrative analysis on a large cancer data set with multiple anticancer drug response  we use graph based multi task regression method to build a robust drug
response prediction system  it is observed that task correlation can improve the prediction accuracy
than lasso which assume independence between tasks  also  we achieved the finding that gene
expression is mostly discriminative in the task of cancer categorization  last  a better integration
method of multiple genomic data is needed since data correlation can be diminished and noise can
be augmented by simple concatenation
