introduction  
  
mexico  is  one  of  the  most  important  place  centers  
of   origin   and   diversification   of   many   plant   foods   
like   cucurbit    avocado    and   the   worldwide   used  
maize   which  was  domesticated  over  thousands  of  
years  in  mexico     
  
by   law    mexico   does   not   allow   commercial  
genetically   modified   maize   cultivation    only  
experimental  parcels  but  there  is  already  evidence  
of   genetic   contamination   in   mexico               and  
there   is   a   lot   o   pressure   to   open   the   country   to  
commercial  maize  crops   
  
motivation  
  
genetic  diversity  is  very  important  in  biodiversity  
assessment    it   has   been   proven   in   many   cases  
genetic   diversity   is   a   key   component   for   species   to  
deal   with   environmental   shift    diseases    plagues   
amount   many   other   things    mexico   so   far   has  
decided   not   to   allow   commercially   crops   of  
genetically   modified   organism    for   those   plants  
that   mexico   is   the   center   of   origin   and  
diversification    in   concern   of   transgene   contagion  
to   wild   and   domesticated   relatives    and   the  
experimental   crops   should   be   carefully   analyzed  
to  minimize  the  transgene  contagion   
  
one  way  to  analyze  if  a  crop  should  be  allowed  or  
not   is   based   on   geographical   distribution   of   the  
relatives   species   and   the   place   where   the  
experimental    or   commercial    is   asked   to  
establish    so   having   maps   on   the   species  
distribution  is  essential       
  
short  background  on  species  distribution  
modeling  
  
potential   species   distribution   models    sdm    is  
related   to   the   ecological   conditions   the   species  
require   to   maintain   populations   in   a   given   region  
       so   the   idea   is   to   find   the   biotic   and   abiotic  
conditions  that  are  suitable  to  the  species   they  are  
many   factors   why   a   specie   not   occupies   all  
appropriate   conditions    e g    mountains    sea    i e   
geographical   barriers    the   presence   of   predator   
etc      that   is   the   reason   they   are   called   potential  
distributions    there   is   a   branch   of   ecology   that  
studies   the   actual   distribution   of   the   species    but  
they   rely   on   extensively   and   well    design   species  
inventories   or   field   works   to   validate   the   model   
which   is   feasible   only   in   cases   like   endemic  
species   or  small  regions   etc     
  
many   approaches   have   been   applied   to   the   sdm    if  
the   data   set   includes   true   absences    absences  
due   to   the   species   not   being   present    rather   than  
to   insufficient   exploration    then   you   have   binary  
data    so   we   can   use   many   statistical   tools   for   this  
kind   of   data    like   regressions    glm   and   gam    but  

most   of   the   data   set   on   specimen   samples    lack  
true   absences    which   is   called   presence   only  
data     for  this  kind  of  data  sets   it  has  been  a  long  
discussion   on   the   methods    to   mention   some    we  
found   the   profile   methods    bioclim    domain   
mahalanobis     statistical   methods    glm    gam   
using   pseudo absences    geographic   models  
 convex  hull   inverse  distance  weighted   and  the  
so   called   from   the   sdm   field   the   machine   learning  
 ml    methods    maximum   entropy    boosted  
regression  trees   svm   etc     
  
recently    it   has   been   shown   the   mathematical  
equivalency   of   the   most   widely   used   ml  
algorithm    maxent   with   other   algorithms    based   in  
the   work   of   william   fithian   and   trevor   hastie   at  
stanford   university   concluding   that   maxent   
boosted   regression   trees   and   others   are  
motivated   by   the   same   underlying   model  
inhomogeneous  poisson  process                          
  
the   approach   explored   in   this   work   is   based   on  
the  idea  of  the  bam  diagram   figure       which  tries  
to   comprise   a   practical    and   realistic    potential  
sdm    which   illustrates   the   relations   between  
biotic    b     abiotic    a     and   movement    m   
elements   
  
solid  circles  on  
the  figure  
indicate  
presence   and  
open  circles  
indicate  
absences  of  
the  specie

from

ga     the  abiotical  suitable  area   go     the  occupied  
area  and  gi     the  invadable  area   
so  the  potential  distribution  area  is  gp     go    gi  
      
  
methods  
  
since  the  work  presented  is  based  on  the  ideas  of  
sobern  at  kansa  university          bam  idea    the  
first   step   was   to   build   a   reliable   dataset   on   biotic  
and   abiotic   dataset   biological   sound   for   the       
races   of   maize   present   in   mexico    first   specimens  
occurrences   from   two   main   sources   conabio  
 www conabio gob mx    and   gbif    www gbif org    
there   is   no   dataset   for   m   almost   for   any   species   
but   there   is   literature   about   the   biology   of   the  
species    preferred   precipitation    altitude   
temperature   etc   therefor  to  get  an  idea  of  m  the  
reading   on   the   biology   of   the   races   of   maize   was  
done    i   propose   a   simplistic   idea   based   on   what   i  
learned         

fidatasets  
  
specimens   occurrences    were   collate   around  
         records   from   conabio   and   gbif    but   a  
quality  assessment  of  the  data  reduced  the  dataset  
to            records    main   problems   were   lacked   or  
incongruent   geographical   data    latitude   and  
longitude     lack   of   a   valid   maize   race   scientific  
name    the   time   consumed   to   cleansing   the   data  
was  far  greater  than  any  other  part  of  the  project   
  
however             record   is   a   sufficient   amount   of  
data   to   work    but   for   four   races   they   were   less  
than      records   so  instead  of  work  with  each  race   
i   follow   the   idea   of   a   groups    or   complexes   
classification    so   maize   has   been   classified   into  
seven  groups         table

to  this   occurrences  dataset  i  over  impose  climate  
data   to   build   the   abiotic   and   biotic   part    these  
climate  data  are  our  variables  to  use  in  the  species  
distribution   algorithm    the   climatic   dataset   used  
come   from   the   worldclim    www worldclim org   
        resolution   is        seconds   of   arc    for   mexico  
this   is        km   pixel   resolution    the   extend   of   the  
study  area  is  the  geographic  box  of                   
            so  each  climate  raster  are                      
             pixels    ocean   pixels   have   no data  
value   all  data  was  processed  in  r   
  

from   the   reading   of   the   biology   of   the   maize    the  
algorithm   was   feed   only   with   the   following       
variables     
bio          isothermally

most   of   the   biology   description    characterize  
maize  base  on  altitude   therefor  for  m  it  was  used  
a  physiographic   provinces  map         actually   there  
is   no   algorithm   that   uses   a   bam   concept   to   build  
specie   distribution   maps    but   instead   these   map  
was   used   to   provide   the   background   data    like  
pseudo absences    but   with   a   very   different   use    
therefor  the  points  for  background  was  randomly  
sampled  from  the  physiographic  region  where  the  
maize   group   has   an   occurrence    based   on   the  
dataset     so   m   plays   a   role   as   a   mask   for   randomly  
points  selection   background  points      
  
a   quick   notion   of   background   data   vs    pseudo 
absences   is   that   pseudo absences   was   used   to  
label        absences    and   then   apply   supervised  
classification   algorithms    the   background   data   is  
used   to   characterize   environments   in   the   region  
where   species   occur   and   used   has   conditions   for  
optimization    in   particular    maxent   uses  
lagranges   technique    therefor   is   very   important  
to   choose   good   conditions    i e    m   should   rely  
mostly   on   the   biological   knowledge   about   the  
species

the  data  has   a  geographical   projection  with   datum

for  each  maize  group   we  build  m  based  on  point

       this  report  includes  only  the  result  of  maxent

visually   inspection   of   the   predictions    locks   a   lot  
like   maxent    but   we   know   that   already

to  assess  the  relative  variables  contribution  to  the

variables   this  can  be  used  as  a  result  in  terms  to  
answer   which   variables   are   more   important   for  
the  species   this  analysis  entirely  depends  on  how

the   expected   area   is   above          which   is  
considering  a  random  model   black  line  in  figure     
and       so  based  on  this  measure   we  get  very  good  
models  like  group      auc            and  the  worst  
case   is   group        auc              even   the   latter   is

based   on   what   it   discussed   earlier   on   this   report   
we   can   build   our   potential   species   distribution  
maps    we   only   need   the   model   for   each   maize  
group   and   feed   the   algorithm   and   the   predictors   
maxent   is   a   probabilistic   algorithm   so   that   
prediction   is   based   on   probabilities    and   therefor  
map   has   values   from       to       probability   of

this   map   can   mislead   or   be   difficult   to   be  
interpreted    because   you   have   to   decide   which  
value  of  the  map   stand  for  presences  and  therefor   
which   for   absences    first   thought   is   that   there   is  
over fit   of   the   model    because   actually   covers   all  
the   data   points    figure            but   we   have   to   use   a  
threshold   and  like  many  things  in  sdm  field  is  an  
ongoing  research  field          
  
thresholds   are   hard   and   much   into   debate    i   use  
an   equal   training   sensitivity   and   specificity   rule   
which  work  good   but  not  always    one  way  to  get  
a   sense   of   usefulness   is   reviewing   the   density  
 frequency    of   the   presences   and   absences   from  
the  training  data   for  example   maize  group        
  
in   this   case    threshold   is            figure         so   we  
classify  or  probability  of  presence  on  to  map  with  
absences     threshold  and  presences    threshold   
  
however    not   always   densities   look   like   the  
following  example   figure       for  instance   we  can  
check   the   plot   densities   of   maize   group        figure

it   is   easy   to   see   why   in   this   case   may   be   another

ficonclusion  and  future  work  
  
applying  machine  learning  to  species  distribution  
modeling    is   an   active   research   field    many  
methods   have   been   applied   to   produce  
geographical  distribution  maps   
  
this  field  is  particular  interesting   because  pose  a  
challenge   in   terms   of   how   data   has   been  
generated    mostly   presences   and   the   highly   bias  
ways   to   sample   those   presences    i e    near   roads   
very   different   methods   of   collecting    dataset  
product  of  aggregated  field  work  for  decades   etc   
even   so    building   models   based   on   machine  
learning   have   proven   it   can   be   very   successfully   
moreover    in   countries   with   mega biodiversity  
and   so   heterogeneous    these   tools   can   help  
decision   makers    use   the   best   possible   achievable  

information   and   analysis   to   promote   biology  
conservation  and  sustainable  use   
  
tweaking   these   algorithms   will   indeed   provide  
better  results   but  at  last  they  will  reach  to  a  limit  
difficult   to   overpass    so   using   ensemble   method  
can   be   an   interesting   research   area    some  
ensemble  has  already  done   but  many  of  them  are  
based   on   algebraic   combination   of   different   model  
results    which   may   be   delivered   a   consensus   map  
but  not  an  strictly  ensemble  method
