of william shakespeare  shakespeares characters are
often held up as examples of authentic humanity  so the
goal of this project was to determine whether his female
characters could be distinguished from his male
characters on the basis of language  in the same way such
distinctions have previously been made among real
people  the problem is slightly different in this case
because the goal is to examine text written by a single
person meant to express the thoughts of people of
different genders  rather than examining texts that are
actually written by people of different genders  previous
work by hota et al      on a shakespearean corpus
suggests this is feasible  as they were able to predict a
characters gender with accuracy in the range       to
      using a variety of models and feature sets  the
current project was able to offer a modest improvement
on these results 
reasonable classification accuracy makes it possible
to examine the distinguishing features of male and female
speech in shakespeares characters  and to consider
whether these differences are similar in quality to the
ones found in previous analyses of modern writing  the
most discriminating features of male and female speech
can also be used to gain some insight into how
shakespeare generally represented gender differences in
his plays 
a secondary objective of this project was to evaluate
the suitability of naive bayes and svm models for the
task of text classification according to gender  both have
been shown to be effective in distinguishing spam emails
from genuine ones  but the features distinguishing male
speech from female speech seem likely to be more subtle 
both models proved reasonably adept at predicting

abstract
the purpose of this project was to determine the
gender of characters in shakespeares plays by applying
machine learning algorithms to the characters word
usage  in particular  a naive bayes model and support
vector machine model were implemented on a corpus
consisting of the words spoken by     characters    
male and    female  both models achieved reasonably
good classification accuracy  with svm unsurprisingly
outperforming naive bayes        to       
interestingly  characters from tragedies were classified
with much greater accuracy than were characters from
either comedies or histories 

i  introduction
work on texts of several different types  including
email and nonfiction articles  has shown that men and
women use language differently         moreover  these
distinguishing language features appear to be consistent
across studies  corney et al      suggest that men tend to
engage in report talk that is assertive and proactive 
whereas women more often favor rapport talk  which is
marked by agreeing  understanding  and supporting the
attitudes of other speakers  argamon et al      similarly
posit that male speech is generally in a more
informational style  and female speech in a more
involved style 
the main question posed by this project was whether
differences in language use could be observed in literary
characters of different genders  in particular in the plays

 

ficharacters genders  a result that is perhaps surprising
given the relatively straightforward way in which they
made their predictions  relying only on word counts and
without any sort of semantic understanding 

from one gender to the other would testify to the
existence of features that a learning algorithm could use
to get a robust idea as to the gender of a character who
used those words more or less frequently  figure  
contains the    most gender imbalanced words from this
collection  even in the absence of machine learning  there
are some interesting things to notice in these data  for
example  shakespeares males are more likely to use the
determiners this and these  which may be seen as
indicators of their more assertive  informational language 
female characters  on the other hand  are more likely to
use the second person pronouns you and thou  which
could be interpreted as a sign of more involved
interaction with other speakers  it should also be noted
that both males and females are more likely to use the
pronouns of the opposite gender 

ii  construction of the corpus
the corpus was assembled in the following manner 
from each play  i selected every female character with at
least    speaking lines  in an attempt to limit training
examples to those with a reasonably large number of
features  this resulted in a total of    female characters to
be added to the data set  i then selected an equal number
of male characters from each play as there were
qualifying female characters  the male characters were
chosen so that the number of lines they spoke was as
close as possible to the number of lines spoken by their
female counterparts from the same play  since males
vastly outnumber females in shakespeares plays and
generally have larger roles  this ensured that the corpus
was balanced relatively equally between the genders
rather than being tilted heavily toward the male side  i
hand labeled each character as either male or female to
furnish the training example labels for the learning
algorithms 
the texts of the plays were acquired from open
source shakespeare      which uses the well regarded
and public domain      globe edition of shakespeares
complete works  for each character  i created a text file
consisting of all their speeches concatenated together and
cleaned up the file by removing stage directions  using
the jfreq application      i created a word frequency
matrix from these text files  in which the jth cell of the ith
row represented the number of times word j was spoken
by character i  i ran jfreq both with a built in stemmer
and without  both naive bayes and svm wound up
performing      better with stemming  for conciseness  i
omit the non stemming results in this paper  the word
frequency matrix and manually entered labels for each
character were used as the inputs to the machine learning
algorithms 

figure  

having established the existence of discriminating
features  i implemented a naive bayes classifier using the
multinomial event model and laplace smoothing as a first
attempt at classifying the data  when trained on only half
of the data and tested on the other half  it achieved a
classification accuracy of        since the number of
examples in my data set was fairly small compared to
many data sets used in machine learning applications  i
decided to maximize the number of examples available
for training by running leave one out cross validation on
my naive bayes model  the increase in training examples
increased classification accuracy across the data set to
      
the naive bayes model can also be used to get an
informal sense of how indicative particular words are of
either a male or female speaker  by running a classifier
on the entire data set and taking

iii  gender classification
to get an initial idea about the feasibility of
differentiating male characters from female ones  i sorted
the word frequency matrix to get a list of all words that
appeared at least     times in the corpus  i then looked to
see whether any of these common words were used
disproportionately by one gender  the reasoning was that
with so many examples of these words  even a       split

 

fiwords in table   that were identified by the model as
especially symptomatic of one gender or the other are
strongly associated with that gender in the real world  or
least in the world of shakespeares time  babe and
petticoat are examples on the female side  along with
consul and mayor on the male side  there are also
words whose associated gender seems counterintuitive 
such as ambassador for females and chat for males  it
seems clear  however  that the learning algorithms under
consideration are detecting real and significant
differences in the language use of male and female
characters 
one interesting question to ask is whether certain
types of characters are more or less likely to be classified
incorrectly by these models  out of the     total
characters     were misclassified by both naive bayes and
svm  figure   shows the percentage of characters from
various categories who were misclassified by both
models

this metric 
proper names were omitted because they are
almost always exclusive to a single play  it may be
interesting to note  however  that proper names actually
occupied the first    spots for males  compared to only
six of the first    for females  together with the common

figure  

in addition to naive bayes  i ran a support vector
machine with a linear kernel using the liblinear
library function      when trained and tested on the same
halves of the data as the initial naive bayes model  it
achieved a classification accuracy of        on leaveone out cross validation  its accuracy increased to       
in both cases  svm did noticeably better than naive
bayes  both models  however  are near or above the
highest accuracy reported by hota et al      

     and      indicate characters who speak more
and less than     total words  respectively  early
characters are from the first half of shakespeares career 
and late characters are from the second  the genres are
self explanatory  but it should be noted that for a good
number of shakespeares plays  there is no consensus on
categorization  if there is not general consensus that a
play is a comedy  history  or tragedy  i am considering it
under other 
as seen from figure    characters who speak less than
    words  despite having fewer features for the
algorithm to use  are actually less likely to be classified
incorrectly than characters who speak more than      one
possible explanation for this is that shakespeares minor

iv  discussion
it seems clear from the success of the learning
algorithms that shakespeare did indeed write his male
and female characters to be both distinct from the
opposite gender and consistent with other members of
their own gender  naive bayes and svm are not able to
offer any sort of semantic or literary analysis  but they
can expose some suggestive lexical features  many of the

 

ficharacters are more likely to conform to predictable
linguistic patterns given their gender  since they are
filling relatively small and mechanical roles in the plays 
another interesting thing to note from figure   is the
relative success of the models on characters from
tragedies as compared to other genres  only two out of   
tragic characters were misclassified by both naive bayes
and svm  there is no obvious explanation for this  but
perhaps the greater emotional weight of tragedies means
that characters use words that mark their positions in the
plays society more clearly  in contrast  shakespeares
comedies often involve cross dressing and other
confusion and playfulness around the issue of gender  so
it is possible that his comedic characters are more likely
to adopt the speech patterns of the opposite gender 
further investigation in this line of inquiry could prove
fruitful for literary scholars working in conjunction with
machine learning analysis  however  it bears
remembering that the number of examples in this data set
is small enough that these patterns may simply be due to
chance 
a final thing to consider is the level of confidence
with which the gender of each character was predicted 
table   lists the    characters classified most confidently
by the naive bayes classifier  other than orlando  who
was mistakenly classified as female  all these predictions
were correct

confident predictions doing so  in terms of characters
from tragedies  table   makes sense alongside figure   
eight of the    characters listed above are from tragedies 
despite the fact that tragic characters make up less than
one quarter of all the characters in the data set  it appears
as though the gender of tragic characters is indeed easier
to determine than the gender of characters from other
genres 

v  conclusion
this project has shown that the relatively
straightforward approaches of using naive bayes and
support vector machines can be effective for
differentiating between literary characters of different
genders  it has shown that shakespeares male and female
characters can be recognized on the basis of their
language  and it has lent support to previous work on
linguistic differences between males and females in
general 
it would be interesting to apply the models trained on
data from shakespeare to the male and female characters
of other contemporary playwrights  such as christopher
marlowe and ben jonson  i think it is likely that these
models would achieve accuracy well over the    
expected with random chance  although they would
probably be somewhat less accurate than they are on the
shakespearean characters on which they learned  a more
difficult test would be to use the models on modern
writings  perhaps emails  blog posts  or newspaper
columns  and attempt to predict the gender of the author 
there does seem to be some overlap between the
characteristic linguistic markers of gender in shakespeare
and those put forward by recent studies on todays texts 
but whether that would translate into success for the
models developed here is unclear
