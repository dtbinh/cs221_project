learning to predict disengagement in educational ipad application
abstract
the focus of this project is to evaluate game design in an educational ipad application
designed for young children and to build a predictive model for learner disengagement  i apply
machine learning techniques to learner activity data collected from an ipad application called
leos pad to predict likely learner disengagement based on gameplay frequency and
performance 
background and purpose
research on cognitive development has revealed the importance of early childhood
education as a predictor for later academic success  learning in young children is highly
dependent upon engagement  since attention span is often a limiting factor for preschool aged
children  consequently  curricula for kindergarten readiness targeted toward children aged   to  
years would benefit greatly from incorporating game elements including animations and
interactive play  computerized  animated games that may be more engaging and easy to use
touch based technology provide an opportunity for advancement toward interactive early
childhood education  chion   schuler        melhuish   falloon        carlson  moses

leos pad is an ipad application made by kidaptive  inc   which consists of an animated
series of appisodes containing a balance of cinematic content and interactive games aimed at
supporting metacognitive development in preschool learners  additionally  the application uses
embedded assessments to customize learning  ipad applications like leos pad may be able to
leverage young childrens interest in interactive games and animation  combined with
opportunity for customized teaching  to optimize development along certain cognitive
dimensions such as working memory and cognitive inhibition 
given the ability computerized applications have for capturing fine grained
measurements of learner activity  and since engagement is a necessary factor for learning  a
predictive model of learner engagement given prior gameplay history seems a suitable first step
to making individual learner recommendations and better understanding which game elements
foster engagement in young learners  this project sets out to build a predictive model of learner

fidisengagement and to examine which features of learner activity indicate engagement  these
predictions may lend further insight into what kinds of game elements are particularly salient for
preschool learners 
data
the back end database of leos pad captures learner activity data including gameplay
events and milestone performance  gameplay events are registered whenever a learner plays a
game  not simply when they log onto the app   milestones are either granted or revoked
depending on how well the learner played the game  milestone performance measures occur at
completion of each game and can be thought of as levels of a game that also reflect the
players performance  for this project  i dissected frequency of gameplay events from this
database activity data  i tallied the gameplay frequency per week for each learner and then
discretized these tallies into the following buckets                             and      i also
parsed milestone events and created features representing grants  level ups  and revokes  leveldowns  for each learner per week  i used weekly gameplay and milestone scores for each learner
for three weeks as the features for my learning algorithms  the learners were then labeled as
disengaged  y    and engaged  y    based on whether they logged any gameplay activity
during the three week disengagement period following the input data  the sample training set
used for this project consisted of gameplay events for more than        individual learners
collected during six weeks 
methodology
i framed my prediction of learner disengagement as a classification problem using
supervised learning given input features that contain gameplay frequency and performance data 
since the data is not gaussian  i chose following classification algorithms  naive bayes classifier
with laplace smoothing  svm  and logistic regression  the data set was split into training      
and testing       sets  since the data set is sufficiently large to allow for this procedure for
measuring generalization error  the data was normalized to include approximately equal data for
both labels 
results
for each classification algorithm  the training examples were determined by discretized
gameplay frequency and performance as mentioned above  i tried the algorithms with three
different features sets  frequency only  performance only  and frequency and performance

wallop  

fitogether  all classification algorithms produced similar testing and training accuracy  see table
    these accuracies represent the best feature set out of all my attempts  a discretized version of
gameplay frequency combined with separate features for milestone achievement for each of the
three weeks prior to disengagement  the same algorithms using only features from one week
prior to disengagement were less effective 
in the beginning of the term  i used a data set that had many learners who logged no
gameplay during the time period of interest and thus had zeros in the feature columns  naturally 
each of these learners was considered disengaged  this skewed the classification algorithms 
especially svm such that they were highly accurate        in performance on the training
and testing set  however  the predictions were flawed because they were not actually good
predictors using gameplay features since so much of the data had zeros predicting zeros  i
corrected this error by examining only learners who played at some point during the   weeks
prior to the disengagement period  although this new dataset produced lower accuracy using
the same classification algorithms  it proved to be a better predictor at classifying learners who
had logged gameplay data and then disengaged during the disengagement period  similarly  i
noticed that the svm produces more accurate testing results        when it focuses on learners
who played during each of the   weeks prior to the disengagement period  had no zero features  
however  these results were misleading again since this limited the training examples to a very
small set and they were mostly disengagement labels  since the purpose of this project was to
predict learner disengagement based on their gameplay data  i chose to report the results with
lower accuracy because i believe they are more applicable to solving the central issue 
conclusions
svm and logistic regression both produced relatively equivalent training and testing
error  the closeness between the training and testing errors indicates a high bias in the data  the
nave bayes classifier had higher training accuracy but lower testing accuracy  indicating high
variance in the data  the high bias and variance may be a result of random noise in the data  one
possible explanation for this random noise is that it is difficult to determine whether reasons for
disengagement are even game related  for example  since preschoolers do not presumably have
control over their own schedule  they may want to continue playing the game  but are forced to
disengage because their parents need to use the ipad or they need to leave for preschool  etc 
another explanation is that engagement may be based on personal preference that cannot be

wallop  

ficaptured in gameplay activity  finally  because the data was based on back end game event
collection and not on structured experimental collection  it cannot be easily verified that all
events represent the expected event of a preschool learner playing independently  many
preschoolers may play with the assistance of their parents or siblings or may have little control
over which games they choose to play and when 
although the classification algorithms produced somewhat reasonable accuracy  another
trend emerged as a feature in the data  time  figure   shows the disengagement rate of learners
across the three weeks leading up to the disengagement period  the fourth week in red
represents the three week disengagement period  one interpretation of this data is that learners
tend to disengage over time in a predictable manner  however  in this data set  we have no
context of the learners gameplay history outside of this six week period  it may be the case that
learners stay engaged for many weeks before our week   marker  it may also be the case that
the majority of our week   learners were new to leos pad and disengaged immediately  yet
another extrapolation could be that learners engage for a week  slowly disengage over the
following three weeks  as the data indicates   but then re engage following some event such as
the release of a new game  or another visit to grandmas house and thus another chance to play
grandmas ipad 
implications for further research
as mentioned in the introduction section  this project is only meant as a preliminary pass
at understanding how learners engage with a game based application  following the discussion
in the previous section regarding timing of disengagement  the next steps of this project would be
to look at the learners entire gameplay history and how their disengagement maps over time 
furthermore  we may be interested in looking at how average learner engagement trends change
centered around the release of a new appisode  new bundle of games  or during holidays
 when children may have more time to play games with their parents   looking at these trends
was not within the scope of this project due to the laborious process required to collect and parse
the data 
another avenue for further exploration would be to use unsupervised learning techniques
to cluster gameplay activity around certain games  this may lend insight into which games are
most successful at retaining learner engagement  clustering the most and least popular games by

wallop  

figame elements may also allow us to see what particular game elements foster the most and least
engagement 
in conclusion  this project provides evidence that we can indeed predict learner
disengagement by using prior gameplay history whose features involve frequency of play and
performance  further exploration will involve digging deeper into which specific game elements
may be involved in predicting learner disengagement
