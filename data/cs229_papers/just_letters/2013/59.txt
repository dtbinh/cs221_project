     is shown in figure    notice that there is a hole
missing in the middle of the data set  this is an artifact of
the remote sensing satellite orbits not traversing directly
over the geographic north pole  the satellites orbital
inclination is decided based on operational constraints 
here  inclination is chosen so as to give rise to a
precession rate which allows the satellite to ascend and
descend at the same local longitudes at the same local
time every day  this orbit is known as a sun synchronous
orbit 

introduction
climate change is a pressing and present issue which has
come to be at the forefront in the last few decades  as
such  understanding climate change is of utmost
importance  in addition to environmental impact  these
changes will have social and economic ramifications as
these changes will affect the way in which we utilize land
and sea resources in the future  the minimum annual
arctic sea ice extent has been used as a measure of climate
change  with record lows being reported in recent years 
this reduction in sea ice coverage has given rise to an
interest in an increased number of commercial shipping
routes through the arctic which have the potential to
significantly reduce shipping distance during the summer
season 
computational methods used in the prediction of sea ice
extent are typically based on high fidelity simulations
which implement physical models of the environment       these involve solving numerous complex differential
equations and are computationally expensive  in this
project  we would like to take a different approach based
on data driven machine learning algorithms  the national
snow and ice data center  nsidc  has a variety of data
sets such as arctic sea ice extent  concentration 
temperature  as well as other information derived from the
analysis of remote sensing satellites  from      to
present  this data has been recorded on a daily basis and is
now publicly available for download 
using machine learning algorithms  the goal of this
project is to forecast future sea ice extent and then
compare our results to those obtained via complex
physics based climate simulations  we hope to show that
a simpler  less computationally expensive  data driven
dynamic model can capture the dominant trends as
predicted by the complex models used in ice forecasting
today

sea ice data

the problem with the data is that different satellites have
been used in data collection over the years giving rise to
different sized holes in different years  examining the
data set has shown that this missing region is always a
part of the sea ice extent since the ice concentration is

the first step in this process was in the acquisition and
proper understanding of the sea ice data from the national
snow and ice data center  nsidc   the data of interest
was both spatially and time varying arctic sea
concentration      an example data set from october    
 

fi    or greater      we can thus gap fill the data sets to
achieve consistency  an example of a post processed data
set is shown in figure    here  we see only the arctic sea
extent in lieu of the finer details of sea ice concentration
shown in figure

we are ultimately interested in modelling and forecasting
the total arctic sea ice extent  it was decided that
modeling both the spatial and temporal sea ice extent
would be too computational expensive and outside the
scope of this project  instead  we will attempt forecasting
of the total arctic sea ice extent as a function of time  a
time series which is derived from post processing of the
data shown in figure    this amounts to determining the
area represented by each pixel as defined by the nsidc
and adding them together  as a validation of our
methodology  we compared our results with those given
by the nsidc  figure   shows the september average
arctic sea ice extent from      to      as calculated by
the nsidc  september sea ice extent is typically used as
a metric for how much sea ice coverage is diminishing
due to the fact that september represents the month with
minimum sea ice coverage  figure   shows this plot as
calculated by our methods for the years      to       we
find that these have nearly identical results  this
comparison gives us confidence that we are indeed using

sea ice forecasting
our goal is to predict arctic sea ice extent using only the
time series data described in the previous section  this
problem amounts to the forecasting of a stochastic
dynamical system based on an observed time series 
there have been many methods developed to tackle this
class of problem  many of which can be found in     
here  we treat the time series as an unknown dynamic
system of the form 

yt  f   yt     yt      yt d  

   

where d is the maximum delay our dynamic system is
reliant on to achieve the next output in the time series 
our approach is to use machine learning algorithms 
specifically support vector regression  svr   to
determine this function f 
svr has been used
 

fisuccessfully in the time series forecasting of financial
systems      and we feel that due to the similar nature of
the problem  this approach would work for this case as
well 

in order to run this script  we had three main variables to
select  the free optimization parameters c and  as well as
the delay d to be used in the model  the training data was
processed to be evenly spaced at    day intervals 
representing approximately a month between data points 
the delay d is chosen to be one half the length of the data
set in order to reserve data points for tuning of parameters
c and   this was done by choosing initial conditions
based on our selection of the delay d  marching forward in
time until the end of the known data set  and comparing
how well the forecasted result matches the known data 
sweeping through several values of c and  allows for the
determination of the optimal model  in addition  we
found that a linear kernel gave rise to the best results 
therefore  this scheme will produce a linear dynamic
model of the system which allows for combinations of
sinusoids and exponential functions  thus  the model can
capture several harmonics as well as exponential
behavior 

the problem was setup assuming m training sets with
scalar output data y i  and input feature vectors x i   the
features are the previous d outputs due to the assumptions
on the form of the dynamic model given in eq       next
we solved the optimization problem associated with svr

validation results
in order to validate the effectiveness of the approach we
used            data for model training and tuning
parameter selection  next  we validated our forecasted
results from      to      against known sea ice extent
data  for this simulation  a delay of d            years 
was chosen  and c and  which minimized the model
error were      and        respectively  the validation of
predicted seasonal sea ice extent for             is given
in figure    figure   shows that our model predicts
seasonal variation as well as yearly sea ice extent decay
well 

where i   i  are slack variables  i   i  are lagrange
multipliers  k xj xi  is the kernel function  b is the offset
variable   is the soft margin parameter  and c is the
variable that determines the trade off between the flatness
of f and the amount up to which deviations larger than 
are tolerated  c and  can be arbitrarily selected before
solving the optimization problem 
the optimization problem given in eq      was solved
using the freely available cvx software package  a
research tool for matlab based analysis of convex
optimization problems          using cvx  this problem

fito get a sense if our estimate was a reasonable one  we
looked at results obtained from high fidelity physics
based global climate model 
figure   shows the
september minimum prediction results obtained from
several different organizations and models from around
the world  each thin colored line represents one ensemble
member from the model  the thick yellow line is the
mean of all ensemble members  and the blue line is their
median value  the thick black line represents
observations based on data from the nsidc  previously
shown in figure     here we can see that the climate
models predict a zero arctic sea ice september minimum
scenario as early as      and as late as       this puts
our prediction of      within the range of results obtained
from this conglomerate of climate models 

forecasting results
now confident in the algorithms ability to accurately
model the system  we reran the model using all of the data
available for training and tuning parameter selection  a
delay of d            years  was chosen and c and  were
found to be       and        respectively  figure  
depicts the parameter selection trade off contour  this
contour illustrates that an optimal value of the tuning
parameters exists

figure   shows the results obtained from the optimal

earlier  this represents the full seasonal variation of the
arctic sea ice as well as the september minimum  the
blue curve is the observed data obtained from the nsidc
and the red curve is the result obtained by forecasting
with the learned model  the leftmost vertical line
represents the initial condition selected for the model
corresponding to the delay d  the rightmost vertical line
represents the point at which forecasting begins  even
though the model was learned using the full data set  the
propagation forward from a single initial condition
demonstrates the strength of the model in that no seasonal
drift occurs with respect to the observed time series and
that it follows the observed data well overall

figure   shows the arctic sea ice september minimum for
both the observed data and that which was forecasted by
the model  running this model into the unforeseen future
allowed us to obtain an estimate as to when there would
be no arctic sea ice in the september minimum season 
our model predicts that this would occur in the year      
which is surprisingly not far in the future

conclusion
we have used machine learning techniques to develop a
linear dynamic model for the forecasting of arctic sea
extent based on support vector regression  svr   this
model is not limited to the september minimum ice
extent  but also includes the full seasonal variation as
well  the results from this model gave forecasts which
are within the range of results obtained via complex
numerical simulations in the arctic sea ice community 
this gives us confidence in the learned dynamic models
ability to capture the dominant trends in the data as well
as in the techniques employed to obtain this dynamic
model
