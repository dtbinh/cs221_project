  abstract
in this project we apply machine learning
techniques to build a music genre classifier 
focusing on the sonic properties of music  as
opposed to metadata  we examine the
classification accuracy of two types of features
coefficients  mel frequency cepstral coefficients
and chroma features  using multi class support
vector machines  we hope to achieve significant
improvements over random guessing and
identify which coefficient yields higher accuracy 
additionally  we will classify songs into different
numbers of genres  to analyze how the number
of classes affects accuracy for each model

the marsyas  music audio retrieval and
synthesis for audio signals  open source
software framework hosts the gtzan genre
collection     
a collection of    second
snippets of       songs in the  au file format
covering ten different genres  blues  classical 
country  disco  hip hop  jazz  metal  pop 
reggae  and rock  although there are much
larger music datasets such as the million song
dataset  the retrieval of actual audio is made
much easier with the gtzan dataset  as
opposed to the million song dataset  which is
actually a collection of metadata  furthermore 
genre tagging in the million song dataset is by
artist  rather than by song  so it does not

classification system rather than hiring musical feature extraction methods for machine

spectrum   but unlike the cepstrum  the
mel frequency cepstrum uses frequency bands
that are equally spaced over
the mel scale  and therefore are expected to
produce a better representation of sound  closer
to actual human perception 

which are generated using the short time
energy distributions over the chroma bands  the
twelve chroma bands correspond to the twelve
traditional pitch classes  c  c   d     and as a
result the chroma features have strong
correlations with the harmonic progressions of
the audio signals  we relied on the open source
generating these coefficients requires a complex chroma toolbox by mller in order to generate
procedure including the fourier transform  so chroma feature for our dataset 
we relied on open source mfcc extraction
software developed by kamil wojcicki     as far     mfccs
and chroma features
as parameters are concerned  we settled on    combined
cepstral coefficients and            hz  both mfccs and chroma features generate a
lower upper frequency limits  a reasonable matrix for each    second snippet of audio

later  which are based on pitch classes  we vectors  for simplicity  but the sheer volume of
thought that contrasting the efficiency of two data that the mfcc holds naturally gives it
different coefficients in genre classification more weight 
would be interesting  and also explored how
increasing the number of features by combining   methodology
both mfccs and chroma features would genre classification is a supervised learning
impact the classification accuracy 
problem  hence we have limited our attention
to the supervised learning algorithms such as
    chroma features

fianother widely used feature representation of
audio signals is the set of chroma features 

support vector machines 
used multi class support vector machines  a
simple application of the traditional two class
support vector machines  a multi class svm
uses a one vs  all approach  one support vector
machine is trained for one class of training
observations  the example is a member of this
class  or is a member of any of the other
classes   the testing example is tested against all
classifiers  and we choose the class with the
highest probability confidence score 

as mentioned above  both mfccs and chroma
features are in matrix form  but the
classification method that we used  multi class
support vector machines  does not support
multidimensional matrices  one feature matrix
per training example   we instead turned each
feature matrix into a feature vector by
appending each row vector after another  to
assess the accuracy of the classifications  we
used    fold cross validation to estimate the we used multi svv code provided by cody   
generalization error 
which builds upon the svmtrain function
provided by matlab 

    multi class svms
since there are    total possible genres  we

figure    comparison of accuracy of the multi class svm on different genre subsets and feature representations

fi  evaluation
we ran three multi class svm tests  one
using only chroma as features  one using only
one mfccs  and the third using both  as
detailed in section      while we worked with
a relatively small data set of only    
snippets per genre where each snippet was
the first    seconds of a song in the particular
genre  the difference in accuracy shown
above  figure    seems to be statistically
significant and therefore applicable to a larger
dataset 

chroma features did not lead to a higher
accuracy than that of mfccs  and at times 
even showed a lower classification accuracy  as
discussed in section      this can possibly be a
result of not equally weighting the two
coefficients  and the lower classification
accuracy than mfccs only on four and eight
genres is possibly due to having too many
predictors and therefore overfitting 

  conclusion and future work

our results suggest that a multi class svm is a
very effective way to distinguish between a
smaller amount of genres  but it loses accuracy
as the graph above shows  both mfccs and when more genres are added  specifically when
chroma features showed statistically significant the added genres have similar musical qualities 
improvements over random guessing  which we although chroma features have significant roles
used as the control to compare the classification in other situations such as music transcription
accuracy  from binary classification to or song identification  the higher classification
classifying snippets into all ten genres

classification
accuracy
declined
exponentially as the number of genres
increased  but the classification accuracy for
mfccs and mfccs with chroma remained
     times higher than that of the control
regardless of the number of genres  chroma
features showed higher classification accuracy
than the control  but significantly lower
accuracy than that of mfccs  this could be due
to the fact that the mfccs have almost ten
times the amount of predictors compared to
chroma features  but large number of
predictors compared to observations might also
lead to overfitting  which tends to produce worse
prediction results for a test set  the large
difference in accuracy is probably due to the
musical property that these coefficients are
based on  mfccs are based on timbre  and
chroma features are based on pitch class  the
combination of mfccs and

accuracy of mfccs  even sometimes when
combined with chroma features  signifies that
the timbre of the sound  as opposed to the note
values  holds greater weights in differentiating
between genres  furthermore  this proves that
even if similar melodies and chord structures are
shared between songs  the combination of
instrumentation and vocal tone determine
genre 
in further work  we hope to use principal
components analysis to determine the     most
representative components of each songs mfcc
in order to better test the effectiveness of
chroma features when combined with mfccs 
additionally  we would like to explore additional
algorithms that might possibly have higher
classification accuracy even on a larger amount
of genres  although the multi class svm is
significantly better than random  it is not
entirely effective
