i  m otivation
over the past years  smart meters have been widely deployed in many countries  these devices replace conventional electrical meters and are able to provide measurements for time intervals of typically less than one hour and
can send these to the utility 
this technology provides utilities a large amount of data and the opportunity to use this data to improve the way
they run the grid  we want to explore some of the possibilities that this data offers  when combined with machine
learning techniques 
ii  i ntroduction
in this course project  we started out by gathering and examining data sets  to explore possible uses  we set
our goal to explore ways of making forecasts on the overall electricity demand  based on smart meter readings for
individual purposes 
our first step was to find an appropriate data set and to convert the data to a way that makes it possible for us
to make calculations  we then tested linear regression and a neural network algorithm on the data for one house
and then expanded our analysis to a larger number of houses 
iii  data set
our data set was provided by the irish commission for energy regulation  cer  as part of the smart metering
electricity customer behaviour trials      it contains smart meter readings for over      homes and businesses
over a period of     years  the readings are in    minute intervals and additional information on the consumers is
provided in survey as a part of the data set 
based on this information  we filtered out commercial customers  since we anticipate these to have some additional
factors influencing their consumption  such as prices and the state of the economy  that do not affect commercial
customers  to perform our calculations  we extracted the readings and the corresponding time stamps for each
individual meter 
iv  a pproach
our analysis is conducted on three levels  a  individual meters  and the whole network with b   house level
forecasts and b   overall forecasts  this way  we can test our models on a small scale first  so we can have a better
understanding of the effects of the algorithms we use  before applying them on a larger scale 
each time interval for a given house represents one sample  be using the power previous times  we calculate our
prediction at that time 
to choose a model  we took some guidance from      which compares different machine learning algorithms for
demand estimations  we first tested out a linear regression model and did not achieve good results  so we chose a
neural network algorithm  we tested different parameters such as the size of the test and training sets as well as
the number of layers of our neural network  once we had found an implementation with a reasonably low error 
we went over to testing a large number of houses and summing up the forecasts for b    then we repeated our
tests by summing up the measurements and performing the algorithm on this sum  i e  in the same way we tested
a single house  but for the sum of all measurements  
to choose our features  we figured that the power at time t is likely to be very close to power at time t    as
well as power at time t     along those same lines  power at the same time one day ago probably also had an

influence on this feature  we added a derivative feature which selected chose the delta power over the last time
interval  we also added a day of week  and hour of day feature  the full list of features can be viewed in table i 
we then attempted to cluster the meters in our data set  we decided that the mean and variance would be the
most promising measures and used a k  means algorithm  unfortunately  we were not able to get good results when
we attempted to translate the estimators for the clusters on the individual houses  clustering therefore remains an
interesting topic to investigate for smart meter data 
v  r esults
as mentioned before  the linear regression did not perform well  as it was not able to capture the non linear
relationship between our features and the data  in particular  peak movements were not captured well  which led to
a high error  therefore  we continued our analysis with the levenberg marquardt neural network algorithm  which
uses back propagation  with    hidden layers  this led to promising results  in particular by tracing peaks much
better than the linear regression  table ii shows how our different algorithms performed  based on the rmse

table ii  measurement error of the neural network model for different settings 
as figure   shows  individual houses trace peaks worse than overall level predictions  we attribute this to the
higher variance for individual houses  typically  the forecasts are higher than the actual value  with an exception
of peak readings  this explains the left shift present in both of the individual readings  the overall level model
does not show this effect  we attribute this to the smoother value of the readings  that result from averaging out
extreme values of individual households and thereby reducing the variance 
a more detailed overview of how actual and forecast demand develop through time can be seen in figure    the
first interesting observation is that  the individual level readings are typically closer to the average  i e  they do not
capture peaks as well as the algorithm run on the sum of the readings 
one further observation that the data shows  is that the deviations increase towards the end of the test period 
we think that our model does not capture yearly seasonality very well  which is not surprising  since our data set
only includes readings for a time frame of     years  also  positive forecast errors are more frequent than negative
errors  this may have implications to using these forecasts to prevent power outages 
to cluster our data  we investigated how the meter readings are spread among our sample by looking at the mean
and variance of the individual time series  as figure   shows  the variance and mean spread out in a cone like
shape  we performed a k  means algorithm with k     and were able to find an interesting grouping  in particular
with the group of low variance and mean households  it may be most efficient to focus on this region for further
analysis  because a high percentage of all households lie here and the variance is low 
vi  c onclusion and f urther r esearch
the most interesting result is  that the overall prediction did not perform better than using the individual readings 
we attribute that to the higher variance when summing up individual readings  an attempt to counter this effect

and find a better result on a middle ground would be to perform clustering on the individual households to find
the predictors and to perform the forecasts with these  rather than on a truly individual level forecast  some work 
such as      has already been done on the classification of households  which could potentially be useful 
the focus of this study was to test what techniques are useful when working with time series data from smart
meters  we did not worry about implementing the algorithms  but a real life solution may require putting the system
in an online learning algorithm  it is also necessary to find a way to deal with the addition or removal of meters 
for our study  the data included readings for all households over the whole period  this is not the case in reality 
due to privacy concerns  it is still very difficult to get good data sets and even more difficult to find a testing
environment  e g  to test controlling power generation   our data set was very useful in many ways  since it
provides realistic and broad data  compared to some data sets that have very short intervals and few houses  the

only drawback was the amount of time required for delivery  which we would have used for further analysis 
given the size of the data set  we did not have any problems associated with a too small sample size  however 
the data did not provide more detailed information on the location of individual smart meters and which distribution
network it was connected to  this could have been interesting for implementing a demand response mechanism 
knowing more precise regional information would also enable us to incorporate weather data  this would be
interesting to explore and the literature on demand forecasting suggests that weather is one of the most important
features of such a model 
a further interesting  but missing bit of information is if a household owns an electric vehicle  ev  or a photo
voltaic installation  pv   these two technologies have a strong impact on the electrical grid if they are widely
deployed  machine learning techniques could help understand and make use of what happens  if for instance
electrical vehicles are charged at different times of the day  or even serve as storage devices and could give back
energy when needed  also  pvs would influence the demand forecasts  since this would implicate uncertainty  not
only for the demand of electricity but also on its supply  unfortunately  this data was not included in the study 
but this would be an opportunity to test out algorithms  such as reinforcement learning to determine the optimal
charging patterns for evs 
a longer time frame    years or more  would be useful to capture seasonal effects  and further investigation is
necessary to see  why the forecasts are typically higher than the actual values 
finally  we conducted our forecasts for a short time horizon  it will be interesting to see how it will perform for
a longer time horizon and which algorithms are better suited for that
