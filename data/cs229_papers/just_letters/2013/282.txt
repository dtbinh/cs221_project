tracing trends in academic interests
uncovering the structure of stanford course offerings
by kevin chavez

introduction
every year there are fluctuations in the number of students enrolling in the large spectrum of courses offered at stanford university  some
courses  such as cs    a and cs      grow immensely in popularity  others remain steady or have slow growth or gradual decline in
enrollment  these trends presumably reflect the shifting academic interests of the institution  both on a student level  elective courses  and an
administrative level  major and university requirements   however  enrollment on a course by course basis is not particularly insightful since
any individual course may abark many independent topics or focus too narrowly on a subset of an interest  on the other hand  bundling
enrollment by department obscures the diversity of academic interests within departments and inter department correlations  if we are to
examine the trends in academic interests  we need a better representation  the goal of this project is to 
stage    use course descriptions to generate a more useful representation of academic interests  one that captures the variance in course
offerings  but is significantly smaller than the set of individual classes 
stage    use course enrollment data as a marker of how much weight the institution places on these academic interests  and trace the dynamics
of these interests over the past several years 
this report will describe results from the first stage of this project  representing academic interests  and delineate the steps needed to complete
the second stage 

representing academic interests
feature selection
course descriptions were initially encoded using bag of words encoding  using terms that appeared less than     of the time and more than
     further  the vectors were weighted and normalized using term frequency   inverse document frequency convention  some hand selecting
of stop words was necessary because of common phrases appearing in explorecourses that contribute little to the overall semantic meaning 
examples of these are instructor consent required  topics include  and such  the final set of words was of size       rather small for text
analysis  but suitable for our purposes 

co clustering with non negative matrix factorization
the problem of finding a useful representation of academic interests can be viewed as an instance of a co clustering problem  in other words  a
useful representation will capture clusters of terms  words or n grams  as well as clusters of courses  the method of non negative matrix
factorization     can yield these clusters simultaneously  this method was chosen over latent semantic analysis followed by clustering because
of its more intuitive results and claimed improved peformance      let the matrix a  rnxd be the matrix of course description encodings  where
n is the number of words used as features and d is the number of course descriptions  we then seek non negative matrices u  rnxk and
v  rdxk such that we minimize

t

j    a   uvt  

   

that is  the matrix product uv is an approximate factorization of the course description matrix  in general  k   n and k   d  matrices u and v
lend themselves to natural interpretations  in particular  the columns of u are vectors in word space that represent academic interests and
provide the basis for a lower dimensional vector space  and the ith row of v is the projection of the ith course description onto that vector space of
academic interests  further  the membership of any particular course in a cluster is determined by its largest coordinate along the axes of the
academic interest basis

example projection
to make this more concrete  lets consider the factorization for k        and look at the projection of a specific course onto the academic
interests vector space 
heres a course description 
topics  statistical pattern recognition  linear and non linear regression  non parametric methods  exponential family  glms  support vector
machines  kernel methods  model feature selection  learning theory  vc dimension  clustering  density estimation  em  dimensionality reduction  ica  pca  reinforcement learning and adaptive control  markov decision processes  approximate dynamic programming  and policy
search  prerequisites  linear algebra  and basic probability and statistics 
its projection onto the     dimensional space is visualized by the bar chart below  fig    

figure    projection of cs     course description onto     dimensional academic interests space

notice that this course has largest components along axes           and     which correspond to the academic interests represented by the
following collection of terms 
index
  
   
   

top words
method  numerical  statistical  quantitative
probability  random  statistics  regression
learning  service

since the strongest component is along axis      this class would be assigned to that cluster  but we can see how its really a linear combination
of these other areas as well 

selecting dimensionality of factorization
there is freedom in selecting the inner dimension  k  of the factorization  to find an optimal value of k  we examine two metrics  the similarity
between cluster directions in the space of academic interests and the stability of the distribution of courses over the separate clusters 
to capture and summarize the structure of stanford academics  it is desirable for the cluster directions to be dissimilar  by nature of nonnegative matrix factorization  these directions will not be orthogonal  but we can plot the maximum cosine similarity between directions as a
function of k as well as the average similarity

decomposing the courses into more than     academic interests starts increasing the maximum cosine similarity  which can loosely be
interpreted as beginning to do fine splitting of clusters  further  the average similarity decays rapidly until about     separate interests  thus 
the proposed useful range for k is between     and     

visualization
despite the reduction in dimensionality  it is nonetheless still difficult to visualize the structure of the academic interest space  in particular  the
basis vectors are over a thousand dimensional  however  they tend to only have significant components in a few of those directions  an
intuitive visual can be created through word clouds with the size of a words determined by the square of the component of the basis vector in
that words direction  figures   and   show sample basis vectors in this represenation

its also helpful to visualize the distribution of courses over these     interest clusters   note  the first cluster is left out of this figure because it
consisted entirely of courses without a description  apparently  the default cluster  for courses having no description  is most strongly correlated with the term research

next steps  tracking shifting interests
with this framework in place  the next step is to use enrollment data to examine the shifting focus on these interests  in this section  the steps to
do so are explicitly stated  this phase of the project is not yet completed  but will be in the near future  results will be available at http   www stanford edu  kjchavez tracing trends dynamics 

enrollment per academic interest
dxm

let e  r be the course enrollment matrix  where d is the number of courses offered and m is the number of years over which this is tracked 
the row of e corresponding to cs     for the past   years looks like 
ei t                         d

   

clearly  we can see a growing interest in this course  however  such a growing interest can reflect a growing interest in any or all of different
aspects of the course  by projecting these enrollment numbers onto the academic interest basis vectors  we can obtain this course enrollments
contribution to overall interest in the various academic topics  let n be a diagonal matrix where n jj is the total number of stanford students in

year j  then we have the academic interest fractional enrollment matrix f  rkxm  

   
f   vn   e

pca to extract directions of greatest variance

using pca on the matrix f will yield the directions in academic interest space along which enrollment varies the most  using the top few
principal components  we can generate a plot of the institutions trajectory  consider the following table of pseudo enrollment data

with the assumption that there were                         and      total students in each of the years since       respectively  we find that
the greatest direction of fractional enrollment variance lies along the vector v  whose elements are displayed in figure

thus one can understand the most important trends in academic interest  by examining one trajectory line and the components of a single
vector  in particular  in this contrived case  we can see that interest in computer  programming  software  element     and language      
engineering      and linear  optimization  algebra      is increasing  while interest in probability  random  variables      and math 
fields       is slowly decreasing  in this case  this principal component explains      of the variance  with this infrastructure in place  we
simply await true stanford course enrollment data 

extensions
non negative matrix factorization gives us a natural way to find clusters of words and clusters of courses for any value of k  the structure of
these clusters will differ by choice of k  but they differ smoothly  this sheds light on another opportunity for insight from this process  by
examining how clusters merge as k decreases  we can see indications of which courses are semantically more similar than others  and possibly
see suggestions for interdisciplinary cooperation  this extension may be pursued at http   www stanford edu  kjchavez tracing trends course search
