   introduction
identity theft  idt  occurs when a victims personally identifying information  pii  is fraudulently obtained
and used by another to acquire products and services  latest estimates from the us department of justice
indicate that    of us households experienced idt in      up from    in       financial loss estimates
from idt have increased from      billion dollars in      to    billion dollars in       javelin       
this illustrates both the prevalence of idt  and the increased economic loss associated with the crime 
a successful idt crime requires a victim whose identity is stolen and a thief who uses the identity to
acquire goods and services via transactions from businesses and government agencies  idt is multifaceted  featuring many variations including fraudulent use of existing financial accounts  opening new
accounts to acquire products and services  obtaining medical care and services  acquiring government
benefits through filing false tax refunds or social security claims  using anothers identity for work 
obtaining housing  and even as proof of identity for law enforcement officials when charged with a crime 
our focus is on the victims of idt  idt impacts individuals in many ways including direct financial loss 
emotional distress  and the burden of resolving problems related to the theft of pii  such as repairing credit 
   related work
considerable research has been devoted to successfully predicting fraudulent transactions  however
research focused on understanding idt victims is largely anecdotal  much of the existing data consists of
self reported idt complaints maintained by government and consumer advocacy groups  white        
persistent lack of data around victims of idt has resulted in an inability to develop ways of systematically
targeting and preventing identity theft through understanding the victim experience  in      the us
department of justice sponsored a detailed random survey designed to collect information specifically
around idt including information on how victims discovered their idt  their financial and emotional losses 
interactions with law enforcement and other government agencies  and the actions and burden required to
resolve their idt  the data from this survey was released in      and summarized in a special report
released by the bureau of justice statistics  langdon         our contribution to the literature around idt
victimization is to holistically model the victim experience using this comprehensive database 
   data overview
our data source is the      identity theft supplement to the national crime victimization survey  ncvs 
produced by the us census for the bureau of justice statistics  the data comprise a statistically valid
sample of the us population with        individuals from        households and includes over     survey
questions designed to measure the extent of identity theft and the economic and emotional costs for
individual victims  although identity theft is a rapidly growing crime it still impacts only a small portion of
the population  of the        individuals in the survey  only       experienced an attempted or successful
idt incident within the two years prior to       our project includes only these       victims 
we categorized these victims by types of idt using the ncvs standard classification from the idt
supplement  credit card  cc   other existing accounts including bank  debit card loan  ea   opening
new accounts  na   together with fraudulent use of personally identifiable information  pii  to obtain
employment  housing  medical care  government benefits  and to avoid criminal charges  however we
discovered that a number of incidents involved multiple types of idt so we added an additional category to
cover this situation  sample sizes for each idt category are provided in table

fiwe encountered several significant data issues related to the complexity of the survey questionnaire 
questions related to the type of idt covered both attempted and successful incidents  however depending
on the victims responses  different sets of questions were asked for attempted versus successful idt
incidents  as our categorization included both attempted and successful idt incidents we merged the two
sets of questions  in many cases this required referencing the survey instrument  interviewer training
materials  and cognitive survey pre testing reports to fully understand the data and make sensible choices
for the merged questions  demaio        
almost all of our features are categorical  and the few that are not we discretized  although we have few
truly missing values for our features  we have many unknown  dont know  and refused responses to
some questions  which were merged together into a single unknown category  after data pre processing 
our data set included    potential features 
   problem formulation
our hypothesis is that different types of idt impacts individual segments of the population in different
ways  our goal is to identify and describe the characteristics of these different population segments  we
used a two prong approach to meet this goal  using the idt categorizations specified by the authors of our
data study  we used supervised machine learning techniques to understand the characteristics of each
category  simultaneously  we used unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patterns within
the data that might suggest alternate idt categorizations 
our supervised ml methodology consisted of three steps  feature selection  prediction and rule learning 
feature selection was done using samme  a boosting ensemble method extended to the multi class
problem  we used a cart based implementation available in the r package adabag  we used the features
selected by samme to predict idt type by using an svm model with a polynomial kernel of degree   with
l  regularization  we then used simplecart to understand the rules behind these predicted categories 
independently  we used cascadesimplekmeans  a weka package  to cluster our data  we then used a c   
decision tree to understand the rules behind the clusters 
   results and analysis

figure    feature selection using samme  x axis shows gini index gain 

 

fibased on the samme results  we eliminated    features with gini index gain equal to zero leaving   
features used in our analysis  the top    features are displayed in figure   
to predict idt type we used an svm model using a polynomial kernel of degree   with l  regularization 
the model was tuned using    fold cross validation on the training set together with a grid search on the
model hyper parameters with a best result of gamma          offset      cost       this svm algorithm
uses a one against one together with a voting scheme for multi class prediction 
we achieved a test accuracy rate of     and a training accuracy rate of      svm model learning curves
are provided in fig     the test accuracy continues to dip with increase in training size  suggesting that
more data may help increase our training accuracy

the strongest samme predictor is vs     how did you first find out about misuse  the categories
for this feature include items that generally map back directly to the types of idt making this feature an
excellent choice for prediction but less useful for understanding the interplay between victim demographics
and victim behavior  thus we decided to use this feature for svm model prediction but not for rulelearning  we then ran the simplecart algorithm  the rule for obtaining the tree branches is with a cutoff
of at least     population of that class in the leaf node  the tree for rule learning is shown in figures   and
   note that all the variables in the tree have high gini index gain  as shown in figure

here are the inferences we made on each class 
class    credit card theft  
the time required to resolve financial and credit problems is small  resulting in low levels of victim
distress  victims of this type of idt tend not to know who stole their id  they most likely had their id
stolen thru lost stolen wallet  garbage  data exposed on internet  or computer hacks  it is more prevalent in
the north east  while credit card theft comprises a majority of our data  most credit card theft is not
successful 
class    other existing accounts  
the victims most likely had their id stolen thru the post office  mail  address change   in responce to
internet scam  or stolen from personal files  it is less prevalent in the north east  it takes longer to resolve
financial and credit problems  most victims have lower incomes than class   
class    pii and new accounts  
this category can have a higher level of emotional distress  the financial losses are usually small  it takes
greater than   months to resolve financial and credit problems  the victims are generally younger 
class    multiple  
these victims tend to know who stole their id  this category usually includes larger dollar amounts of
theft  accompanied by higher levels of emotional distress  these crimes are more often successful 
generally taking longer to process resulting financial problems 
in parallel  we ran cascadesimplekmeans to explore whether any natural groupings and patterns were
present in the data  we found two distinct clusters  we identify these clusters as cluster   and cluster   and
note that each have similar distributions of idt category types used above  we then used the c   
algorithm for insight into the characteristics around each cluster  the results are shown in figure   
the tree presents an interesting story around attempted versus actual idt  people taking precautions against
idt are less likely to be victims of actual idt as opposed to attempted idt  these precautions include using
security software  changing passwords  and checking credit reports

   conclusions and future work
our analysis provides useful insights into idt victim experiences and does suggest that idt impacts
individual segments of the population in different ways  in addition our clustering results strongly support
the value of engaging in precautions designed to prevent idt 
our svm model accuracy rate was lower than we had hoped and was likely impacted by having
unbalanced idt classes  the largest class  credit card idt had the largest accuracy rate at     followed
by accuracy rates of     for existing accounts      for new accounts and use of pii  and     for multiple
incidents of idt  incorporating methods for handling unbalanced classes may improve accuracy results 
our data is challenging due to survey respondents difficulty characterizing their idt experiences into the
pre determined survey idt categories  demaio        and the large number of unknown answers in the
survey responses  incorporating mechanisms to better handle such unknown values may improve our
results 
finally  we created a new class multiple to deal with survey respondents reporting multiple idt incidents 
finding a better way to deal with this data may result in cleaner categorizations
