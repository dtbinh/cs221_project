abstractjosquin des prez was one of the most important
composers of the middle renaissance era  however  there is disagreement in the academic community about what musical pieces
should be attributed to him  the project described here uses a
machine learning approach to classify dubiously attributed works
to josquin or his near contemporaries  using features known as
counterpoint modules  we were able to build supervised learning
models from a training set of known music  we attempted both
multi class  classifying all composers  and binary  josquin or not
josquin  classification  the best multi class model had a crossvalidation accuracy of      the best binary classifier had an
area under the roc curve of       and an accuracy of     
using this model  we predict that between    and     of our test
set of     questionable works were actually written by josquin

i ntroduction

josquin des prez was a renaissance composer of the   th
and early   th centuries  he is considered one of the greatest
composers of the era  however  his fame caused his name to
become attached to many musical pieces from that period  and
there is disagreement in the music community regarding which
historical pieces should actually be attributed to him  working
in conjunction with professors jesse rodin and craig sapp
of the josquin research project  we analyzed songs from the
renaissance for which there is scholarly consensus regarding
whether or not they were actually composed by josquin     
this comprised our training set  using this data  we built a
machine learning model to classify borderline cases

data

we used data collected by the josquin research project
at the stanford center for computer assisted research in the
humanities  ccarh   the research group has been collecting
and manually digitizing music from josquin and several of his
contemporaries from the renaissance  typically  these songs
are choral music with four voices in a song  the digital
files include information from historical scores from these
composers  including each voice  notes  rhythms  and pitch 
and are available in many formats  including a matlab friendly
matrix  the research team has also developed tools to easily
query for features in the music that may be useful in attributing
the works  such as note patterns  specific rhythms  and chord
progressions 
of specific interest is a group of music traditionally attributed to josquin  but determined by field experts to be of
questionable origin  due to conflicting sources  a dearth of
sources  and or differing musical styles   we built a machine
learning model that performs well on the music with confident
labels  the training set  to make predictions on this questionable group of music  the test set

we first began this supervised learning problem as a multiclass classification problem  we extracted several features
deemed interesting by researchers rodin and sapp  described
below  and applied the features to several machine learning models  such as naive bayes  support vector machines
 svm   and classification trees  separately to try to classify
which renaissance composer was responsible for each piece of
music  we used the results from these multi class classifiers
to select relevant features  we then generalized these models
to our primary problem  binary classification  josquin vs  not
josquin   finally  we combined the binary classification models
using an ensemble method  our feature extraction  feature
selection  and models were implemented in matlab

the data available for our use in classification were digital
representations of scores  including information such as note
pitch and timing  we tried a variety of features with varying
levels of complexity to differentiate between authors 
a  simple pitch intervals
the first pass of analysis relied simply on creating histograms of the pitch intervals between adjacent notes in the
same part  each feature is the number of times that a given
pitch interval occurs in the song 
b  counterpoint modules
the concept of counterpoint is an important tool for the
analysis of music from josquins period           counterpoint
modules are features that compactly capture information about
how a composer uses pitch transitions  and were recommended
by our music faculty advisers  a counterpoint module can be
described by three pitch intervals  and is made up of data
from two of the musical parts  for example  consider part a
with temporally adjacent notes  a     and  a     and part b
with notes  b     and  b     that begin at the same time as
 a     and  a     respectively  the counterpoint module for
these notes consists of the intervals between notes  a     and
 b       b     and  b      and  a      figure   shows a single
counterpoint module  each feature is the number of times a
counterpoint triplet appears in a musical work 
c  dissonance
the use of dissonance was emerging in josquins time 
so the use of dissonant chords was changing in this time
period  dissonance in the renaissance era is defined as  nds

pitch intervals
counterpoints
rhythms

we applied several machine learning models to fit our
problem  we began with a naive bayes approach  with laplace
smoothing   we then used the libsvm package to utilize support vector machines     and built in matlab functions to train
models using classification trees  we then took the probability
outputs of these models and used a robustboost ensemble
learner to combine the models appropriately  additionally  we
performed feature selection and principal component analysis
 pca  to reduce the dimensionality of our features 
a  model choices
we chose these models based on how well we thought they
would apply to the problem  resources available to us  ease of
implementation  and how well they would fit into our ensemble
framework  naive bayes was a model that seemed suited for
our primary features  counting occurrences of counterpoints  
the classification trees were utilized mostly due to ease of
implementation  the robustboost algorithm was chosen for
our ensemble learner because our data was fairly skewed  of
our training samples  less than     were written by josquin 
b  feature reduction
the cardinality of the set of all features present in the
training set is much larger than the number of training examples  table i below illustrates the dimensions of each of
our features  we believe that this caused nonlinear classifiers
such as gaussian kernel svms to over fit  in order to mitigate
this problem  we attempted to reduce the dimensionality of the

d imensions of each feature

feature space by using greedy forward search feature selection
and pca  the forward search feature selection proved to be
very inconvenient in terms of computational time  and did not
lead to improvements in initial tests  so it was abandoned  after
experimenting with different numbers of principal components
used  we used the components that accounted for     of the
variance in the original data  this resulted in a feature space
with a dimension that was slightly lower than the number
of training examples  use of pca significantly improved our
computational time  however it did not significantly reduce the
generalization error estimated using cross validation  and we
remain suspicious of over fitting 
vi 

rhythmic patterns in a single measure can be analysed
for each voice part  this can be quantified as a binary value 
with each bit representing whether this beat contained a note
attack  a histogram of the distribution of the combinations of
rhythms can be extracted  this method required time signature
information in the data files  so the data format for each score
provided by the josquin research project was altered before
analysis of this feature was completed

because we have a limited data size      total songs  
we used cross  validation to measure the accuracy of our
models  we relied on mostly    fold cross validation to judge
our progress  for multi class classification  we used crossvalidation accuracy  sum of the diagonals in the confusion
matrix divided by the total number of songs  as an estimate
of one minus the generalization error  for binary classification models  we looked to maximize cross validated receiver
operating characteristic  roc  and the corresponding area
under curve  auc  before attempting to classify the disputed
cases

a  multi class classification
the results of various tests are shown below to illustrate
the performance of our multi class classification models  figures     show the results of ten fold cross validation testing
with various sets of features and machine learning approaches 
each graph shows all of the information from the confusion
matrix  the labels below the bars show the actual known
composer of the pieces in the bars above  and the size of the
bars represent the number of pieces by that composer that were
classified to belong to each composer  perfect classification
would leave only the single bar corresponding to that composer
above each composers name 
through experimentation  we found that the counterpoint
features were the most predictive of composers  adding other
features did not significantly improve our results  we give a
sample of the results from different sets of features below 
figure   shows the poor results produced by using only
pitch intervals with a multinomial naive bayes classifier 
figure   shows the greatly improved results using counterpoint
features  and figure   shows the results using a gaussian
kernel svm  even after reducing the dimensionality of the
feature space using pca  naive bayes produces a slightly
lower estimated generalization error than the svm  we believe
that this could be due to over fitting by the svm

b  binary classification
our binary classification model results are displayed and
discussed in this section  using    fold accuracy predictions 
we plotted roc curves for each of our binary classification
models in figures     below  the features of these models
were counterpoint modules  using pca where appropriate  
the classification trees in figure   performed the worst for
our task by a large margin  the auc of the trees      was only
slightly above random and significantly lower than the auc
of the other models  the naive bayes model and gaussiankernel svm performed very similarly  auc of      and     
respectively   the results are close enough that the difference

in performance may be due to our selection of the crossvalidation folds  our ensemble method  with an auc of      
did not perform as well as the svm or naive bayes model  we
hypothesize that the difference in performance may be due our
training methodology  training a meta learner requires data for
training  meta training  and testing  because we have a limited
sample of observations  each step in the meta learner was able
to train on less data than the individual models  providing a
less accurate model  thus  a direct comparison between the
ensemble learner and the other models may not be entirely
applicable  a summary of auc values for our various binary
classification models is presented below in table ii

final classification of works with questionable attribution

questionable attribution that should be attributed to josquin
according to our classifiers  all three classifiers indicate that
between one third and one half of the pieces have features
similar to those in josquins body of known works

c onclusions

the most important conclusion that can be drawn from
this work is that the counterpoint module is a useful feature
for classifying musical works by composer  this feature alone
offered considerably more power for classification than any
of the other features we considered  and in our final analysis 
counterpoint modules were the only features used 
a naive bayes learning model performed at least as well
as any of the other models that we attempted to use  this is
somewhat surprising given that more complex devices such as
svms are better able to model features that are interrelated
with one another as we would expect the case to be with
counterpoints  we believe that with the relatively small training
set  the svm tended to over fit the data  when we used cross
validation to examine performance  the svm usually had very
low training error  however  the estimate of the generalization
error could not be brought below about      the fact that
the naive bayes model performed so well may suggest that
the occurrence of different counterpoint features is relatively
independent of others  the ensemble learner also performed
slightly worse than the naive bayes model  further analysis
is required to discern the underlying cause  we suspect it is due
to the small amount of training data available and or specific
ensemble learner used 
our results may also be used in the future as evidence when

ficlassifying pieces within the set of works with questionable
attribution  this work can provide researchers with an estimate
of the probability of each piece having been composed by
josquin

some extensions of this work include different selections
of features and model approaches  some features that we had
considered implementing  but were unable to include were
analyzing notes  rhythms  and dissonance on strong beats  in
addition  increasing the range of intervals allowed may yield
more information about songs 
additionally  discussion with other groups that attempted
to solve similar problems provided ideas about other feature
approaches  first  at least one of the other groups did not use
counterpoints  but did have success in accurately classifying
some of the work  they used less complex features  but the
key to their success was to use combinations of simple features
determined by pca  we believe that our prediction capability
could be improved by integrating simple timing and rhythm
features with our pitch based counterpoint features 
finally  an interesting continuation of this work may be a
clustering based approach to the renaissance music  the music
and features could be used to identify which composers were
most similar  if they changed over time  and or if any of the
unknown music exhibit such trends
