   introduction
     pop singles
what do stevie wonders isnt she lovely   jimi
hendrixs voodoo chile  not to be confused with
voodoo chile  slight return    and sufjan stevens
casimir pulaski day all have in common  while 
your first response should be  correctly  that they are
incredibly good songs  it might surprise you to know
that none of these classics were released as singles 
surely stevies producers heard isnt she lovely 
  did they really think it would be less popular than
as  of course  studios usually make good choices
as to which songs should be singled out  but why not
automate this process  hopefully identifying along the
way components of songs that are crucial to popularity
and success 
many others have tried to automate musical tasks  like
evaluating track similarity  berenzweig et al         
genre classification  tzanetakis   cook         or hit
detection  dhanaraj   logan         but no work has
addressed the problem of putting an albums best foot
 or feet  in case of multiple singles  forward  although
others have addressed different problems  we use similar methods  namely representing music by harmonic 
rhythmic  and lyrical features

the weight of longer words 
   number of unique words  the total number of
unique words used in the lyrics  songs with more
unique words are generally more complex  think
paul simon  the mississippi delta was shining
like the national guitar     versus justin bieber
 baby  baby  baby  oh     
   number of total words  this gives us some idea
of the relative number of lyrics in the song and
therefore the length of the vocals in the song 
     audio features
audio features are not yet in use  but will be extracted
using the opensmile audio feature extraction toolkit
 eyben et al          see     for more on what type of
features can be extracted 

   methods
     single albums
it is relatively easy to learn a model that correctly
predicts the singles in single album  albums are generally small  and usually have only one or two singles 
so often times a quadratic model  like svm with a
quadratic kernel  will be able to fit a decision boundary with no learning error 

   data acquisition
     lyrical features
while for now i am using lyrics copied from any of
the myriad lyrics websites  i also have access to the
million song dataset  bertin mahieux et al         
a collection of lyrics data already prepared for use in
learning tasks  it is in bag of word format  stemmed 
and available in a sqlite format   i also have access to
the musixmatch api  which gives free  albeit limited 
access to the musixmatch database of lyrics 
each songs lyrics are treated as a bag of words  and
then the following features are extracted 
   averge word length  i use the   norm to increase

     multiple albums
of course  every album is different  so we want to find
the most general model of all of the models learned on
each of the single albums  it wouldnt do to compare
models fit on very different albums  say kanye wests
yeezus and daft punks discovery  so we need to normalize the models  for each training instance x i    we
 i 
replace its jth feature xj with
 i 

xj  j
var xj  
next  we want our model to learn how to incorporate each of the models from the different albums

filearning how to pick singles

into one model  we do this in two ways  our first
method is adaboost  using the samme algorithm as
described by  zhu et al         and as implemented in
scikit learn  pedregosa et al         
the adaboost algorithm works roughly as follows 
   each of the n observations has its weight initialized to n 
   fit a classifier from a family of weak classifiers to
the observations
   compute the weighted error of the classifier
   reweight the observations  giving missclassified
observations higher weight
   repeat the past two steps for as many classifiers
in the family as you like

   future work
     more data
data was surprisingly difficult to come by  even the
large  freely available data sets with lyrics are incomplete  and work still has to be done by hand to label
songs as singles  in the future  it would be helpful to
scrape a site like www azlyrics com to get the lyrics
i need 
     audio extraction
i have opensmile working  but it is difficult to specify which type of feature generation to use  also  this
is inherently a challenge because of the huge variety of
features that can be generated  for example  opensmile can extract  from a single song  signal energy
 over all intervals of the song   loudness  voicing probability  how much of the signal is human voice   etc 

references
   classify an instance into class k so that the sum of
the errors of all the weak classifiers is minimized
we can apply this method to the set of all songs in
the training set  after they are renormalized in feature
space 
the second way we incorporate multiple albums is by
chaining together k nearest neighbors and svm as follows 
   given an album a  find the average a of its songs
in feature space  this is the representative song
of the album 
   find the k albums in the training set whose representative in the feature space are closest to a
   allow each model fit by the nearest neighbor albums to vote on the normalized songs of a  so
that the prediction for each song is the majority
vote of the k classifiers 
note that we use svm with the radial basis function
kernel  allowing us to caputer the one or two out of
many
