abstract
from optimizing a cars performance  encouraging
safer driving to accurate insurance pricing  it is desirable to
be able to identify a driver by his driving style  using a car
data supplied by metromile inc   driving styles were
analyzed and core features were extracted  two learning
models were investigated and evaluated support vector
machine  svm  and multinomial logistic regression  high
accuracies of around     were achieved for identifying a
particular driver from a group of up to   drivers 
i  introduction
in the world today  there are over one billion cars with
different drivers interacting with each other on the roads 
each driver has their own driving style  which could
impact safety  fuel economy  and road congestion  among
many things  the precise relationships between driving
style and their effects have not been well characterized 
although there is some general consensus that  aggressive 
driving  e g  speeding  hard braking  tailgating  has a
mostly negative impact  except perhaps on driver
enjoyment   for example  research done by honda in     
has shown that hard braking can increase road congestion
and decrease fuel efficiency      knowing the driving style
of the driver could be used to encourage  better  driving
styles  combined with driver records or ideal driving style
models  ones driving style could be compared and used as
an immediate in dash feedback while driving  or by scaling
auto insurance rates commensurate to the aggressiveness of
ones driving style  in rental cars for example  such
discounts for good driving habits could help promote safer
driving on the roads  the identification of driving style
could also be used in conjunction with known
classifications  such as safe driver  aggressive driver 
or good fuel economy driver to optimize the
performance of the vehicle based on the drivers style  for
example  adjusting the transmission and other powertrain
parameters to conform to the drivers preferred style 
the goal of our project is hence to analyze the driving
style and to accurately identify a driver from a group of
drivers based on the driving style  the dataset provided by
metromile consists of the speed  heading  and
instantaneous gas mileage of    vehicles as recorded using
a driving sensor plugged into the car  the hypothesis is
that each driver will have a particular driving style  and
though this could depend on vehicle  route  road conditions 

figure    raw data indicates that the vehicle was driven at
intervals  and these were split into separate trips by time 
each trip forms an example  with an associated feature
vector 
drivers mood  weather  etc   we expect that there will be
some common elements which could be used to identify
the driver  from the dataset provided  we can extract out
features and a model using the driving data from one
vehicle  driver  against the data from a few other drivers 
and use it to identify the driver  evaluating the accuracy of
the data features and the learning methods 
ii  analyzing metromile data
the dataset provided by metromile inc  recorded
speed  heading  and instantaneous gas mileage for   
vehicles  unfortunately  not every vehicles data had
sufficient time resolution  or even data points  making it
difficult to obtain accurate data features  a dataset from  
vehicles was ultimately used in our analysis 
a  raw data
fig    plots the raw speed data from metromile inc  
and it is observed that the data occur in intervals  each
corresponding to a trip  as such  we broke up the raw data
into different trips  and analyzed each individual trip data 
each trip was then taken to be a single example data point
with an associated feature vector 
b  features
some features that were hypothesized to be indicative
of driving behavior are the acceleration   deceleration

regions where the heading vary significantly are
indicative of turning   b  the speed vs  turning radius are
plotted for the entire dataset of a driver 
profile  turning speed vs  radius  speed  and gas mileage 
while some of these features have a dependence on
external factors such as road conditions and the type of
vehicle used  we assumed here in our work that these
features capture more information with regards to the
driving style of individual drivers rather than on these
external factors  such assumptions are necessary given the
absence of data that was taken with a controlled route and
vehicle 
i  speed and gas mileage
the speed and gas mileage data points for each trip
were binned into    and    groups respectively  and the
normalized distribution is then used as a feature vector for
the trip  the normalized distribution for an example trip is
shown in fig     this distribution can be interpreted as a
probability distribution in which a driver drives with a
particular speed gas mileage for a single trip 

figure     a  regions with significant acceleration were
distinguished from the speed profile  red  start of
acceleration region  blue  end of acceleration region   b 
the speed profile was fitted  green  with a  rd order
polynomial to reduce the noise  acceleration data was then
derived from the fitted speed curve   c  distribution of
acceleration points  taken at each second from the fitted
curve  for the acceleration regions of an entire trip 

ii  acceleration   deceleration profile
to obtain the acceleration   deceleration profiles for
each trip  we zoomed in on the regions where significant
acceleration   deceleration was observed    acceleration
regions are shown in fig   a   because of the noisy data
points  we fitted a  rd order polynomial curve to the speed
data at these regions  fig  b   and through differentiation
of the fitted polynomial curve  obtain the curve for the
acceleration  using the fitted curve  the acceleration data is
then resampled and binned into    groups  fig  c   the
normalized distribution was then used as a feature vector
for the machine learning algorithm  this normalized
distribution can again be interpreted as a probability
distribution in which a driver drive with a particular
acceleration for a single trip

driver identification

figure    accuracy of the svm model for differentiating
between two drivers  the driver to be identified has the
label    while the other driver has the label    error
bars represent the different combinations of picking two
drivers from a pool of six  and the random picking of
examples to create a dataset with an equal number of
positives   negatives 
iii  turning speed vs  radius of turn
zooming in on significant changes in heading  and
together with speed data  we extracted the turning radius 
and fig    shows the speed as a function of the turning
radius for a driver 
iii  modeling
a  preliminaries
to assemble the labelled examples  the dataset for the
driver to be identified was labelled positive      while
that for the others was labelled negative      one issue
was that the datasets for positive  s and negatives  s
were very different in size  because     some driver data
had a large number of trips and fine data points  while
others had sparser data     the dataset that is used for the
others category could consist of multiple drivers 
leading to a larger set  this caused the decision boundary
to shift in favor of the larger set  due to the objective to
minimize the error  which was weighted heavily towards
the larger set because of the difference in size  to reduce
this problem  the sets for  s and  s were made to be
the same size  size of the smaller set   by randomly picking
examples from the original dataset to form a reduced
dataset  since there were multiple permutations of picking
examples from the larger set  the simulation was re run a
series of times using different picked examples  a
variation in the accuracy values is thus seen  and is
captured by the error bars in the presented results 

figure    accuracy of individual features of the svm
model for identifying between two drivers 
the labelled data was then divided up into a training
and a test set  which consisted of     and     of the
available data respectively  and support vector machine
 svm  and multinomial logistic regression models were
trained and evaluated 
b  svm
implementing a linear svm for classification  and a
trip feature vector made up of acceleration deceleration
profiles  speed  and gas mileage  the results are shown in
fig    for distinguishing between two drivers  since data
from six drivers were available  all possible combinations
of two drivers were taken and this is represented by the
error bars  in addition to the random picking of examples
to create a dataset with an equal number of positives and
negatives   accuracy values are given for the model run
against the training set itself and the test set  for both the
driver to be identified    and the others     category 
these accuracy values represent the fraction of the trips for
which the driver was correctly identified using the model 
high accuracy        is obtained 
while the above result is for the combined feature
vector  one thing that we can look at is the accuracy of the
individual features  fig    plots the accuracy of the
individual features for identifying the driver of the test set 
it is seen that the gas mileage feature gives the highest
accuracy  followed by acceleration deceleration  and speed
features  the turning speed vs  turning radius feature is
noticeably low in accuracy         doing worse than a
random choice  this is likely to be due to a lack in data
points  as most trips have under    turns  more data points
per trip are required to boost the accuracy

driver identification

figure    accuracy of the svm model as a function of the
pool of drivers to identify a driver from  the   label
indicates the driver to be identified  while the   label
indicates the others group of drivers 
also investigated here is increasing the number of
drivers in the others group  the accuracy  fig     for the
combined feature vector drops slightly  but is generally
still around     
c  multinomial logistic regression
using the speed  gas mileage  and acceleration
probability distribution as feature vectors  we also
implemented
multinomial
logistic
regression 
unfortunately  with the full     elements of the feature
vector  the multinomial logistic regression was unable to
converge  we therefore performed principal component
analysis  pca  on the dataset consisting of the six
vehicles and identify the first    principle components 
after performing this step  we proceed to implement the
multinomial logistic regression with the    new features 
fig    shows the result for the logistic regression when
distinguishing between two drivers  as we increase the
number of drivers in which to classify  the accuracy drops
from     to     
iv  discussion
our results show that the normalized distribution of
speed  acceleration  and gas mileage are good features to
be used for the machine learning task 
as we increase the number of drivers to be classified 
the accuracy of the classification decreases  this decrease
is expected  as with more drivers  there will be a greater
overlap in the driving behaviors between different drivers 
it is seen that using the svm with two categories  driverto be identified vs  others  generally gives better results
than the multinomial logistic regression  especially when
the number of drivers in the pool goes up  depending on

figure    accuracy of the multinomial logistic regression
model as a function of the group of drivers to identify a
driver from 
the applications required accuracy  our algorithm can be
used to effectively classify within a small set of drivers 
the feature vector currently includes speed  gas
mileage  and acceleration probability distribution 
information regarding the vehicle  it might be possible to
improve our classification accuracy by using other
information such as the amount of grip force that the driver
exerts on the steering wheel  and the reaction time from the
changing of the signal light to the actual movement of the
car  this additional information can be included in the
svm or the logistic regression to improve the
classification accuracy 
v  conclusion
presented is a model for learning the driving
characteristics of a particular driver that could be used to
identify him from amongst a pool of drivers  using speed 
gas mileage  and heading data  features of
acceleration deceleration profiles and turning speed vs 
turn radius were extracted and binned to form a feature
vector  svm and multinomial logistic regression were
performed and show that for a trip with a combined feature
vector  a driver prediction accuracy of over     can be
achieved  distinguishing amongst up to six drivers
