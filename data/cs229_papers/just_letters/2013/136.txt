i  introduction  
                this  project  is  a  clustering  application  of  gene  expression  data  in  different  tissue  
types   we  have  a  large  dataset  of  gene  expressions       samples        gene  
sequences    where      samples  are  data  from  kidney  and  the  other      from  liver   the  
gene  expression  level  of  one  specific  gene  sequence  is  quite  similar  in  different  
tissue  types   so  our  intuition  is  that  most  gene  expression  would  be  the  same  across  
all  tissue  types   yet  cell  differentiation  lies  in  a  small  group  of  genes   we  are  
particularly  interested  in  identifying  these  gene  sequences   
  
ii  motivation  
  
the  gene  expression  data  are  large   messy  and  highly  correlated   here  is  a  plot  
of       randomly  selected  gene  expression  data  from  our  dataset   

the  color  in  each  cell  represents  a  certain  level  of  gene  expression  activeness   from  
the  figure  we  can  see  a  clear  boundary  between  sample      and  sample       which  
indicates  differences  in  gene  expression  activeness  in  different  tissue  types   
however   the  figure  overall  has  great  similarity  among  samples   which  also  verifies  
our  intuition  that  most  part  of  gene  expression  would  be  similar  in  cell  
differentiation   thats  why  we  propose  this  method  to  identify  similarity  and  
difference  in  gene  expression  data  of  different  tissue  types   
  
  
traditionally  biological  data  are  clustered  using  pca  technique   but  results  
from  pca  are  also  messy   meaning  that  loadings  of  each  principle  component  or  
cluster  are  mostly  non zero   this  property  of  pca  make  interpretation  extremely  
hard   as  non zero  loadings  would  exhaust  researchers  attention  in  finding  
significant  gene  sequence   so  we  propose  using  sparse  pca   a  modification  of  
traditional  pca  to  impose  a  similarity  in  clusters  of  different  tissue  types  and  a  
sparse  loading  of  each  cluster   which  would  help  to  solve  this  problem   

  

fiiii  problem  definition  
  
the  problem  we  want  to  tackle  here  is  to  build  up  a  system  that  can  identify  
similarities  and  differences  among  gene  expressions  in  different  tissue  types   the  
hypothesis  for  this  problem  is  that  most  gene  expressions  in  different  tissue  types  
should  be  the  same   while  a  small  portion  of  genes  expressed  differently   which  lead  
to  different  functionality  of  tissues     
  
  
in  this  project  we  only  investigated  into     tissue  types  for  comparison   the  
input  data  of  this  system  would  be     n by p  matrix   where  n  is  the  number  of  
samples  in  a  specific  tissue  type  and  p  is  the  number  of  gene  sequences  extracted   
data  in  each  cell  of  the  matrix  represents  the  gene  expression  activeness  in  the  
specific  tissue  type  and  specific  sample   the  higher  the  gene  expression  activeness  
is   more  frequently  that  dna  sequence  has  been  translated  into  proteins   the  
outputs  are     clusters  of     different  tissue  type   a  shared  loading  matrix  of  the  two  
clusters   and  how  the  system  works  will  be  illustrated  in  the  approach  section   
  
iv  approach  
  
a  nice  output  from  the  system  has  the  following  properties           top  k  clusters  
from     different  tissue  types  that  are  close  enough  but  yet  preserve  some  
differences        shared  loading  matrix  of  the     cluster  sets  that  is  also  sparse        
the  model  should  also  achieve  best  prediction  error     
  
in  order  to  achieve  a  nice  output  stated  above   we  use  sparse  pca  technique   
along  with  cross validation  to  find  the  optimal  parameters  such  as     of  pcs  and  
shrinkage  parameters   
sparse  pca  
  
the  idea  of  sparse  pca  is  to  solve  the  following  objective  function     

  
we  use  x   and  x   to  denote  the  gene  expression  data  for     different  tissue  types   
here  pc   and  pc   are  the  two  cluster  sets  for  x   and  x    the  first     terms  of  the  
objective  function  is  to  ensure  minimum  reconstruction  error   we  use  l   
regularization  for  the  last     terms   as  sparsity  would  be  nice  property  of  l   
regularization   the  term  
  is  to  ensure  a  sparse  shared  loading  matrix  of  the  two  
clusters   and  the  last  term  is  to  ensure  similarity  between  the  two  clusters  
constructed     
  
the  way  to  solve  this  objective  function  is  using  the  following  algorithm   
step      assuming  that  the  algorithm  will  produce  pcs  of  size  k   meaning  that  pc         
and  pc   are  both  n by k  matrices   b  would  then  be  a  k by p  matrix   initiate  
pc    pc   and  b  to  be  matrices  with  all  entries  zero   
step      assume  pc   and  b  are  fixed   the  objective  function  becomes  an  ordinary  
lasso  of  matrix  pc   after  a  linear  transformation   this  can  be  solved  for  pc   
with  lars  algorithm  that  will  be  explained  later   

fistep      after  getting  an  optimal  pc   given  pc   and  b   we  can  do  the  similar  
procedure  for  pc   and  b   which  in  turn  will  give  optimal  result  given  other     
matrices  constant   
step      we  can  obtain  the  optimal  results  of  pc    pc   and  b  by  iterating  between  step  
   and  step     until  convergence   
  
lars  algorithm  to  solve  lasso  problem   
general  form  of  lasso  problem   

    

step    start with all coefficients j equal to zero   
step    find the predictor xj most correlated with y
step    increase the coefficient j in the direction of the sign of its correlation
with y  take residuals r y yhat along the way  stop when some other
predictor xk has as much correlation with r as xj has 
step    increase  j  k  in their joint least squares direction  until some other
predictor xm has as much correlation with the residual r 
step    continue until  all predictors are in the model
  
these  two  algorithms  would  give  optimal  results  given  parameters  k           but  in  
order  to  find  the  optimal  parameters  k      and      we  can  try  a  grid  of  values  of  k      
and     and  use  cross validation  to  find  ones  that  minimize  the  prediction  error   
  
cross validation  algorithm   

step    for a given value of parameter set     k         divide the training
set to be m roughly equal datasets  use m   sets as training and the
remaining one as a validation set 
step    use the m   sets as training to get the optimal results from the above
objective function  then use the remaining one set to compute
prediction error  do this for all combination of m   possible sets and
compute the average prediction error  this would be the crossvalidation error for the given parameter set   called cv   
step    do step   for all possible values of   and the final result would be  
with minimum cv   
  
  
one  last  problem  of  building  this  system  is  how  to  evaluate  the  performance   
for  this  system   the  whole  point  is  to  find  results  that  produce  minimum  prediction  
error   so  prediction  error  is  the  primary  evaluation  of  the  system   the  way  to  do  this  
is  to  extract  a  small  portion  of  the  input  dataset  as  the  testing  dataset   replace  the  
holes  with  average  of  the  specific  gene  sequence  in  specific  tissue  type   after  that   
using  the  new  dataset  as  the  input  data  and  solve  in  the  system   this  test  dataset  
would  be  used  to  evaluate  performance  of  the  system   
  
  
  

fiv  result  
  
this  result  is  important  because  it  gives  a  guideline  for  scientists  to  investigate  
into  genes  that  have  different  activeness  level   and  it  may  lead  to  other  findings  in  
genetic  studies   
  
  
the  cross validation  error  for  parameter  set      k        has the following

plots 

  
  
this  plot  clearly  showed  a  surface  of  prediction  errors  of  a  grid  of     and      each  
surface  is  corresponding  to  a  value  k   the  number  of  clusters  produced  by  the  
system   all  surfaces  in  the  plot  achieves  the  minimum  cross validation  error  at        
      and                 
  
if  given              and               the  plot  for  different  k  values  is   

  
hence  the  value  k  that  achieves  the  global  minimum  error  is  k         we  can  then  pick  
k                     and              to  be  the  optimal  parameter  set  for  this  specific  
dataset   
  

figiven  these  selected  parameters   the  system  produces  clusters  of  prediction  error  
        on  the  preselected  test  dataset   
  
vi  future  work  
  
after  the  system  gives  out  two  cluster  sets  for     tissue  types   it  is  also  critical  to  
look  into  biological  meaning  of  the  results   since  we  imposed  for  a  similarity  
between  the  two  cluster  sets   it  would  be  interesting  to  investigate  into  the  
difference  between  the  two  sets   that  difference  would  potentially  lead  researchers  
to  find  gene  sequences  that  played  a  significant  role  in  cell  differentiation
