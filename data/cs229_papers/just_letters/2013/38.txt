prediction of outcomes in mild tbi in the ntdb
traumatic brain injury  tbi  accounts for      million ed visits and           hospitalizations each year  
although guidelines exist for how to triage and treat these patients based on the severity of tbi  there is no clear
consensus statement on which patients need intensive care unit  icu  admission  and wide variability in practice 
many hospital guidelines currently suggest that all patients with intracranial hemorrhage of any severity be
observed in icu due to risk of decompensation and possible need for intervention  several studies have tried to
make prediction models of outcomes after head trauma     in particular  some single center datasets have
shown that certain classes of low risk patients have low probabilities of decompensation  and so may be better
observed on the hospital floor in order to conserve hospital resources  for instance  nishijima et al used binary
recursive partitioning on the uc davis tbi icu data set and found that four parameters  abnormal mental status
 gcs        non isolated head injury  age      years  and swelling shift on ct  was     sensitive and    
specific with a roc auc of        washington et al  showed that age     years  anticoagulation therapy  frontal
contusions and high volume intracranial hemorrhage were significant predictors of decompensation  but did not
evaluate their model   overall  no consensus prediction formula exists  thus a robust formula for clinical
decision support with regard to icu admission for mild tbi patients is needed  since moderate severe tbi is an
easier call for icu admission   only one study to date has looked at icu admission in mild tbi  here the goal was
to find a robust score for prediction that is also sparse  clinicians are highly unlikely to apply a complicated rule 
especially if requires input to a computer in a black box model  thus penalized linear regression was chosen 
with a hypothesis that the lasso penalty would be able to identify a sparse model for easy applicability 
data set 
the national trauma data bank  ntdb  is a national dataset with millions of post trauma hospitalized
patients and several hundred variables  the ntdb has many variables not related to patient physiology  i e  
number of trauma surgeons at a given hospital  region code of place of injury  and does not contain as many
physiologic parameters as some single institution data sets  however  it does have many of the key physiologic
parameters identified by prior studies as being significant predictors of outcome  as well as icd   diagnostic and
procedural codes 
methods 
patients from           with an icd   code of either skull fracture      xx     xx      xx     xx  or
intracranial injury      xx     xx  were selected as the base dataset  only patients with a glasgow coma scale
 gcs  of    or     i e   only mild head injuries  were included  patients with an injury type other than blunt
were excluded 
all physiologic variables  age  gender  ems and ed vital signs  gcs  and injury severity scores  were
included as dependent variables  all tbi related icd   codes were included as dependent binary variables to
either       or   decimal places  i e   the model matrix with   decimal icd   codes was      times larger and
sparser than the   decimal icd   matrix   for the   decimal icd   codes  all fractures were grouped into two
single variables  open fracture         and closed fracture          plus           thus there were only six
tbi variables in this case  the number of co occurring non tbi diagnosis codes was included as a continuous
dependent variable  as an estimator of number of non tbi injuries   response variables tested were either 
neurosurgery  yes no   or complicated status  yes no   where complicated status was defined as neurosurgery
and or a critical care intervention  patients with missing physiologic data were thrown out  i e  imputation was
not done  
critical care interventions were modelled after those defined by nishijima et al  icd   procedural codes
were used to identify interventions which might reflect decompensated status  these included  vasopressor

fiuse          interventional angiography      x   invasive hemodynamic monitoring      x   invasive mechanical
ventilation of any duration      x   blood transfusion of any component      x   and conversion of arrhythmia 
including cpr      x   the presence of any number of these interventions was coded as a binary variable 
undergoing neurosurgery     xx    xx  was coded as a separate binary variable  the complicated response
variable was coded as the presence of either or both a critical care intervention or neurosurgery 
penalized logistic regression  using package glmnet in r  was carried out at an alpha of       i e   lassoweight elastic net parameter    regression was run in   models  where each of       or   decimal icd   tbi codes
as dependent variables  along with all other physiologic variables  were tested against both neurosurgery only
and complicated response variables  all variables  continuous and categorical  were scaled  in accordance with
lasso penalized regression    the data were split into training       and test       sets  five fold cross
validation was used  error curves were constructed to test for bias in the model  roc curves were constructed
for three different values of the penalty lambda  effectively  different numbers of included variables  for each
model  coefficients were extracted at a lambda for which       variables were included 
to test for presence of nonlinear effects  soft margin support vector machines  with c         using a
gaussian kernel were made using package kernlab in r  both response variables were tested 
results 
a total of          patients were included for analysis  of these       underwent neurosurgery      
had a critical care intervention  and      had one or both  and so were complicated  regression using  decimal icd   codes and yielded models with best error rates of     for neurosurgery only and     for
complicated outcomes  the models were evaluated for several different values of lambda  yielding predictors
with different numbers of variables  figure  a   roc curves for the   decimal icd   model showed greater
attainable sensitivity and auroc in the neurosurgery only outcome than for the complicated outcome  figure
 b   coefficients were pulled out of the models  and showed that neurosurgery alone was most strongly
predicted by open skull fracture  the joint complicated variable was also predicted by physiologic variables
such as age and injury severity  table    
i next tested the   decimal icd  codes  for which all fractures had been further collapsed into variables
open closed   roc curves were similar between the   decimal and   decimal models  figure  b   moreover  the
coefficients for both response variables were  by design  enriched for physiologic parameters compared to icd 
codes  table

fifive decimal icd   code matrices were tested and showed similar error rates to the   decimal icd
codes  but with many more dependent variables included for each regression model  they were thus not studied
further  and the data is not shown 
error curves were constructed and showed that for both response variables  the model suffers from a
high bias problem  in that test and training error rates converge at an unfortunately high rate  see figure    note
that initial error is low because there the response variable is infrequent   for this reason  soft margin svms
were constructed  to see if a non linear gaussian kernel could better fit the data  svms were tried with a c
allowance of       and     error rates were best at c    as expected  training set error rates were lower for svms
than for linear regression  however  test error rates were similar for both methods  neurosurgery only response

conclusions 
the goal of this project was to produce a sparse model for predicting which patients with mild tbi will go
on to require care that would require an icu stay  there is no hard definition of what it means to require
intensive care  in clinical practice  reasons for admission to the icu are varied  and often up to clinician
preference and local factors  thus  modelling this outcome is difficult and prone to bias  here i modelled two
different response variables  either ever undergoing neurosurgery  or a complicated variable  which is a
composite of neurosurgery and various icd  coded procedures that indicate the need for a higher level of care 
need for neurosurgery is a narrow response  but one which is easily defined and should be captured well by the
ntdb  using the combined neurosurgery   critical care intervention response variable is likely a better predictor
of needing icu care  but there is likely bias in how or whether the comparatively minor procedures like invasive
monitoring and blood transfusion are captured in ntdb 
two different dependent variable sets were used in prediction  as it was not clear de novo to what
extent icd   tbi code specificity would be required by the model  there was little difference in the predictive
power  as judged by auroc  between the models with collapsed   decimal icd   codes and the models with
sparser   decimal icd   codes  since the   decimal icd   code versions led to sparser prediction scores  i will
plan to proceed with that model in further work 
the predictive power of this model cannot be judged by simple error rates  as the positive outcomes are
rare  thus a model that predicted no patient would ever go for neurosurgery would still be correct       of the
time  for this reason  i used auroc as a better judge of predictive power  in clinical application  the most
important goal is a high sensitivity  it could be disastrous to have a patient decompensate outside the icu 
whereas if we could safely decrease the number of unnecessary admissions to the icu by even      the cost
 

fisavings could be large  thus  in practical application  a cutoff for this prediction score would be chosen for a
sensitivity of       even at the expense of a very poor specificity        
sparse prediction models built with l  penalized regression performed well in this project  with aurocs
for models with      variables performing nearly as well as those using all variables available  the variables in
the predictive models for a complicated outcome are  not surprisingly  more enriched for non tbi parameters
 higher iss  higher rates of other injuries  lower bp  higher pulse   similarly  the neurosurgery only response
variable is highly dependent on the presence of open fractures and intracranial hemorrhage  which does not
seem to add anything new to our understanding 
there is still significant error in the regression models constructed here  error estimation curves show a
high bias problem with both responses  soft margin svms with gaussian kernels failed to show any
improvement in test set error  thus the bias that is present in the current model is unlikely to be from a simple
nonlinear relationship of the present data  but rather from confounders not present in the ntdb 
comparing our model directly to previous models like that of nishijima et al is impossible because of the
differences in the variables present in each dataset  and the nature of the differences between a single center
trial like theirs and a national database like the ntdb  still  it is encouraging that age and non head injury appear
to be important in both models  notably gcs was a large part of the nishijima score  but here we conditioned on
only mild gcs     or      so the magnitude of this variable was comparatively small  interestingly  when i applied
nishijimas cutoff rules  without ct findings  variable not present  to the present dataset  it failed to accurately
partition the patients into complicated uncomplicated groups  the failure of that model in the ntdb highlights
how different the two data sets are 
this study had several weaknesses  first  no risk adjustment for hospital type was done here  in a
subanalysis i found that trauma accreditation level of a given hospital is significantly associated with our
response variable  however  inclusion of trauma level of a given hospital in a patient prediction score doesnt
make intuitive sense  further work should be in trying to identify a patient level factor that can capture this bias 
the second weakness is in the building of the complicated response variable  it is highly likely that minor
procedures are not all captured by icd   codes  and  moreover  that they may be missing in nonrandom ways 
further  these criteria do not capture all patients that could potentially benefit from a higher level of nursing
care and monitoring 
here i have shown an early potential application of penalized logistic regression to a large national
dataset  ntdb  in prediction of mild tbi outcome  these preliminary models do show some predictive power for
the constructed response variables  and the coefficients selected make intuitive sense  better response variables
and corrections for bias need to be built into the models in the next phase of work
