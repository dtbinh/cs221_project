 

predicting societal and economic impact of
future natural disasters
laura griffiths  chang liu  and divneet mandair

abstractwhile anticipating the outcomes of natural disasters
is a growing area of interest to a diverse body of organizations 
little formal work has been done to make these predictions for
specific countries  we propose a novel methodology that
combines supervised learning on historical disaster and
demographic data with intelligent clustering to expand a relevant
training set for particular countries and disaster types  by
clustering countries at snapshots in time  based on developmental
stages and disaster event profiles  we develop more specific sets
of historical data that improve predictions on the number of
people killed and financial cost of various disaster types 

i  introduction

natural disasters have driven much research effort
towards developing predictive models of when and where
disasters will strike  an equally important aspect of disaster
anticipation  however  is understanding the predicted impact
of such disasters for particular countries  organizations from
the un to google have devoted considerable resources
towards understanding the countries most at risk of high
disaster impact     developing this risk profile for different
countries allows international organizations to effectively
tailor their aid efforts 
few attempts  however  have been made to systematically
predict the societal and economic impacts of specific natural
disasters within particular countries  part of the challenge with
developing this type of model is the scarcity of historical data 
for a given country  of particular disasters  moreover  impact
of a natural disaster varies substantially with the development
stage of a country  such that historical disaster data may no
longer be particularly useful as a training instance for a
country that has developed significantly over time  to resolve
this  we propose a novel methodology that predicts the impact
of natural disasters  for a given country  based on that
countrys own history of disasters of the same type and
similar countries that have experienced the same disaster 
our end goal is to answer the question  given a particular
country and disaster that is expected to occur  can we reliably
predict that disasters impact on the country  measured by both
economic and societal impact

ii  data description   pre processing
for historical disaster data  we use the em dat dataset

 em   which collects information on disasters from          
across all countries  an event is classified as a disaster if one
or more of the following criteria is met     or more people
reported killed      or more reported affected  declaration of a
stage of emergency  or call for international assistance 
features included in the dataset consist of the number of
people killed  killed   financial cost  cost   country  date of the
event  and a few others  we expand this set to also include a
region and subcontinent code for the country of each disasters
occurrence 
demographic information for countries  which can be used
to categorize similarly developed nations  was obtained from
the world bank  wb       this data is organized into   
categories  ranging from climate change to infrastructure 
with over      distinct features across all topics 
both datasets were restructured such that a row  instead of
representing a single country with values for its attributes over
time  is represented as a country year pair  this facilitates
comparisons of countries that  although at different periods of
time  may be at similar developmental stages  integrating both
datasets with this structure yields a        x      sparse
design matrix 
our analysis focuses on predicting the em features killed
and cost as measures of societal and economic impact

baseline model

to develop a baseline prediction for each disaster type 
initial supervised learning models consisted of either the entire
em or the combined em and wb datasets  linear
combinations of features in these datasets were tested  such
that

higher order polynomials  while also examined  had much
poorer cross validated mean squared test errors  likely due to
overfitting  baseline results are depicted in table    for
predictions on killed only

first  we notice the poor predictive power of using either
the em disaster features or combined em and wb features in
a linear model to estimate killed  and cost   the following are
insights from our baseline analysis
 the em dataset is sparse for a particular country year
entry and a given disaster type 
 training  based on em features  across the entire set
of country year pairs  as expected  leads to estimates
of  that are less likely to reflect a particular
countrys risk level 
 naively combining wb features with em features
worsens the models performance  while we might
expect demographic data to be correlated with
disaster outcomes  training over the entire range of
data appears to hide the added value of countryspecific information 
one issue immediately addressed was the underlying
assumption of normality in our linear models  the plot below
shows the residuals error in predicting the number of people
killed for the flood disaster type  using a log transformation of
the response variable  both killed and financial cost  addressed
non normality of the errors and greatly enhanced both r  and
testing errors in the linear models  across all disaster types

iv  further processing  missing values   imputation
to address the sparsity of our design matrix  we evaluated
numerous imputation techniques  prior to implementing this 
however  it was necessary to develop a heuristic to remove
rows and or columns with excessive missing values  this

helps reduce the number of necessary imputations  which can
drastically skew predictions  to determine the acceptable
thresholds for missing values in rows and or columns  we
iterated over a broad range of thresholds for each disaster type 
the thresholds i and j  where i corresponds to a row threshold
and j corresponds to a column threshold of our design matrix
x  were chosen such that


 i  j    argmin   y   t xi  j     

   

where y is a vector of responses  either killed or cost  the
overall result was a series of matrices with an optimized
amount of missing data across rows and columns  specific to
each disaster type  for most matrices  a row threshold of    
 i e  up to     of data entries missing   and column threshold
of     was found optimal  we then evaluated both svd and
kth nearest neighbor  knn  imputation methods    on these
outputs  ultimately  knn imputed matrices contained fewer
outlier values in its imputed values 
v  feature selection
one key aspect of our prediction system is developing
clusters of countries at similar development stages with
comparable risk profiles  thus  we do not want to simply
cluster country year entities based on all their disaster and
demographic features  but rather those features that most relate
to a given disaster event  we used backward selection  with a
linear model  to isolate those features  across the em and wb
datasets  most predictive of disaster outcomes  for each
particular disaster type  from the initial list of over     em
and wb features  the final number of features after all
processing ranges from       across disaster types 
vi  clustering
by clustering countries at similar risk and developmental
stages  we aim to expand the set of historical disaster data
available to make predictions on a specific disaster event for a
particular country  prior work has looked to classify countries
by a development index      however  our analysis differs
from this by    using country specific demographic
information to inform the cluster groups and    allowing
countries at different time points to be grouped into the same
cluster  the added flexibility of    may allow for less intuitive
combinations of particular countries 
we first looked to cluster country year pairs  for a given
disaster type  based on wb features  we chose k means as our
clustering algorithm  as we view countries as belonging to
distinct groups rather than probabilistically weighted across
multiple groupings  within sum of squares across cluster
groups suggested the wb features partition country year pairs
into roughly   groups  a result that was consistent across all
disaster types  the plot below  for flood wb features  depicts
clusters along the first two principal components of the data 
these components capture approximately     of the
variability in the wb features for floods  the   distinct

fi 
groupings confirms the within sum of squares analysis  so we
chose to use   wb clusters for each disaster type  these
groups  more qualitatively  correspond to pools of similarly
developed countries at particular snapshots in time 

the pseudo code below summarizes the joint em and wb
cluster approach 

flood wb cluster plot

clustering using the unaltered wb features  however 
results in skewed groupings  with nearly all the country year
pairs bucketed into   group  possible explanations include the
high number features  approximately       for different
disaster types  and the high linear dependence among
attributes  in particular  many of the features that persist in the
wb set  even after backward selection  are highly correlated 
examples of such features include population density and
number of live births  clustering quickly becomes unreliable
with a high number of noisy features      to address this and
remove co linearity in the attributes  we employed pca 
across all disaster types    principal components consistently
captured over     of the variability in the wb feature vectors
corresponding to each disaster type  to facilitate comparison
between clusters within different disaster types  all wb
features were reduced to   principal components  using these
dimensionality reduced components gave more reasonable
cluster groups  in agreement with the plots above 
finally  we also explored partitioning country year pairs
based solely on disaster features  again  we used k means as
our algorithm  the plots below  for earthquake and storm
disasters  rescales the kmeans distances of em features to   d
and then plots the clusters  interestingly  as the plot suggests 
country year pairs can be partitioned into   distinct groups 
similar to wb features  this partitioning along solely disaster
characteristics indicates  that  independent of how developed a
country is  there exist different disaster event profiles for a
given disaster type  to test this notion  we then employed  
distinct clustering mechanisms for country year pairs    
clustering solely off of the  dimensionality reduced  wb
features and    independently clustering by wb features and
em disaster features  using   clusters  for each   our final
analysis evaluates both mechanisms in our prediction system

vii  results   analysis
a  model choice
once all processing and clustering steps were completed  we
began making predictions on the two primary outcomes for a
given disaster type  number of people killed and cost  note 
these predictions were made within clusters of countries with
similar risk and developmental profiles  features  as
previously described  consisted of dimensionality reduced wb
features and disaster features  both narrowed by backward
selection to obtain a feature set more highly correlated with a
given disaster type  
second and third degree polynomials  for both predictions
on cost and killed  drastically overfit the training set  crossvalidated test errors for these models were significantly larger
than those from simpler linear models  in predicting the
number of people killed  however  two alternative models
were tested  since number killed is a form of count data 
poisson regression was implemented for each disaster type 
with our updated design matrix x and parameters   the
predicted mean of the associated poisson distribution and
likelihood are as follows

surprisingly  the poisson fit  across disaster types faired
poorer than a base linear model  again  comparisons were
made using mean squared errors on cross validated test sets 
one reason for the poorer fit of the poisson may be the
distributions imposed equivalence of the mean and variance 
particularly for disaster outcomes  where variation is high
even within a selected disaster type  this assumption does not
appear to be valid  we then attempted a negative binomial fit 
which allows for a gamma mixture in the poissons  rate 
while the negative binomial did outperform the poisson
regression models  allowing for a dispersion parameter     
in most cases   base linear models continued to outperform
these more sophisticated models  due to its consistent
performance  the following analysis was performed with our
original regression hypothesis  the overall result of our
prediction system is a series of linear models  each specific to
a disaster type  that are trained off clusters of similar countries
and can be used to make a prediction for a given country year
pair 
the two plots below show the progression of the testing r 
and mean squared error as components are added to our
prediction system

in general  while r  measures range from moderate to poor 
most of the components added to the system consistently
reduced mean squared errors in test sets  this is most true in
predicting the casualty from epidemics  the dotted blue line in
the plot above   key insights from our results are discussed
more below 
b  type  of  clustering     usage  in  prediction  process  
the two types of clustering performed in our analysis are
   based solely on wb features  m  in above plots  and
   based on both wb and em disaster features  m  in above
plots  
in case     country year pairs are first assigned to cluster iwb 
based on wb features and then an independent clustering run
assigns the country year pairs to cluster jem  based on em
features  predictions are made within each combined em and
wb cluster  iwb  jem

for both estimated generalized error       vs        and r 
      vs         approach    outperforms     this confirms our
clustering diagnostics  indicating that country year pairs can
be independently sorted based on disaster event profiles and
development stage within a given disaster type 
in order to more deeply understand the physical structure
underlying our clustering design  we visualized the wb
clustering index assigned to countries through the years in the
map below  colors in the map represent cluster indices  and
countries that experienced a development stage shift  i e  were
assigned to different wb clusters in different years  are
represented by multiple colors  one insight is that many of
the clusters agree with intuition  for instance  europe  along
with japan  australia and a few other countries  is clustered
separately from central southern africa  additionally  we see a
variety of changes in cluster assignments  central and south
america seem to shift from being clustered with parts of
europe to its own developmental group over time  this

fi 
shifting pattern lends support for our decision to develop
clusters based on country year pairs vs  countries alone 

to further analyze the makeup of our joint em and wb
clusters  iwb  jem   we simulated our prediction process  where
a country  disaster type  time of occurrence were given as
inputs  imagine  for instance  we were interested in predicting
the number of people killed if an epidemic were to happen in
ethiopia  in       supplying these as inputs  along with em
features such as month of occurrence  duration  etc  of the
epidemic   our prediction system could then grab the most
recent year       or prior  of wb features for ethiopia  with
both em and wb features  dimensionality reduced by pca  
the system then assigns ethiopia      to an appropriate joint
em wb cluster  iwb eth  jem eth   by minimizing the euclidean
distance of this joint feature vector to each clusters centroid 
the map below highlights the countries that would be
included in the extended training set for the causality
prediction for an epidemic in ethiopia in       as expected 
other central and south african nations are included in the
cluster  interestingly  afghanistan and pakistan are also
assigned to  iwb eth  jem eth   our system thus appears to
intelligently use similarly at risk and developed countries to
enhance a prediction for any particular country 

clusters  of      and average mean squared test error of     
this contrasts with the linear models for storm killed
predictions  which have an average r  of      and average
mean squared test error of      one reason for this large
variation in performance may relate to the nature of the
disaster event itself  wed expect epidemics to occur only in
certain countries  classified at a particular development stage 
moreover  when they do occur  they likely will have a
consistent  quite harmful  impact on the countries they occur
in  storms  on the other hand  occur universally in almost
every country  their impact will vary highly  depending on a
variety of intricate factors  we see through our clustering
these intuitions are supported  when sequentially assigning
country year pairs to clusters iwb and jem for epidemics  most
country year pairs        are bucketed into a particular pair
 iwb  jem           conversely  when the same clustering
mechanism is applied for storm disasters  country year pairs
are more evenly dispersed across a variety of  iwb  jem  pairs 
thus  the economic and societal impacts of epidemics are
more consistently associated with a particular country risk
profile and development stage  enhancing the models
predictive power 
viii  conclusion
our goal was to develop a methodology to aid in the
prediction of outcomes of natural disasters for particular
countries  we showed that pools of countries with similar
demographic and disaster event features  can be used in a
supervised learning problem to enhance predictions when
compared to more nave models  while accuracy in our
predictions varied  many of our estimates are typical for
natural disaster prediction      ultimately  this analysis is but
one step in a broader effort to quantifiably identify those
countries most in need of aid when catastrophe strikes
