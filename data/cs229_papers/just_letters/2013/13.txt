abstract
in       bollen used twitter data to find high predictability of twitter
sentiment on the stock market       we hypothesized that while bollens results from
analyzing the full breadth of the twitter pipeline found significant results  fine tuning
the twitter pipeline to only high impact financial tweets would improve the data
signal and further improve results  as a result  we filtered a dataset of the twitter
pipeline for high impact tweets by user and financially related short list keywords
and applied sentiment analysis on this filtered data and combined this in conjunction
with djia stock market outcomes  analyzing this data using logistic regression  svm
and time series analysis  we found modest outcomes  with predictability  peaking at
        while our filtered approach did not reach the levels claimed by bollen  we
showed substantial results in showing that applying appropriate pre filtering on
twitter data is necessary in running future analysis on the predictive power of the
twitter pipeline to maximize the sentiment signal of twitter data 

   introduction
in behavioral economics  market outcomes are affected by the sentiment of
market agents themselves  twitter  a platform publishing over     million tweets per
day  seems to be a treasure trove of big data to mine to find an appropriate proxy for
market sentiment  bollen achieved impressive results from the sentiment of the
twitter pipeline on the dow jones industrial average in   dimensions  motivated by
these promising results  we suspected we could augment bollens analysis in a few
ways     we would filter the twitter data to use only high impact financially related
tweets  preliminary analysis of tweet dataset quickly found that the vast majority of
tweets were inane and utterly unrelated to the stock market  we suspected that proper
filtering of twitter data would reduce the risk of a garbage in garbage out lowsignal to noise dataset     we would apply svm techniques to the filtered data to find
an efficient decision boundary condition     we would apply time series methods in
our prediction  we were motivated by the potential of combining these tools to build
on the results of bollen 

   data
    source
our dataset consisted of two sources  first  we have a slice of the full twitter
pipeline  from june    to december           which consisted of about     million
tweets      each tweets consisted of timestamp  username and tweet content  our
second source was daily closing prices of the dow jones industrial average for the
same time duration as our twitter dataset     
    preprocessing
motivated by our desire to improve the signal of our dataset we pre filtered
our dataset for high impact content as well as high impact users  we generated a list

fiof     high impact finance related twitter users        and filtered twitter content for
only those high impact users  individuals on this short list would likely tweet content
finance related and they would better approximate the sentiment of the stock
market  secondly  we filtered our dataset based on    high impact finance related
keywords picked by ourselves  filtering for these high impact keywords would
increase the signal of our dataset by obtaining only tweets related to the stock market
in content  which in preliminary analysis  consisted of a small minority of overall
tweets 
further preprocessing techniques were performed to scrub tweet content 
including making all content lowercase  removing all tweets that were not in english 
using these preprocessing methods  we obtained a cleaner dataset with far less
noise than the original  given our original dataset of about     million tweets  our
filtering did not pose a risk on overall sample size 
     sentiment analysis
to obtain sentiment for each tweet in our filtered dataset  we used a preconstructed twitter sentiment analysis word list by alex davies to obtain
dimensions of happiness and sadness of each tweet token  overall sentiment for
each tweet was taken based on averaging the sentiment for all applicable tokens in the
sentiment word list  we would use these sentiment statistics as the basis of our
sentiment analysis 

   machine learning models
our goal was to use machine learning techniques to use sentiment data of a
given day predict a binary change  positive or negative  on the djia closing price of
the following day  given our djia and tweet sentiment data  we performed several
machine learning analyses  including logistic regression  svm with linear  radial and
sigmoid kernels  and applying time series analysis techniques in including previous
day djia changes  we applied a few cross validation techniques to train our
algorithm  including    fold     fold and leave one out cross validation  results are
below      shows results for machine learning analysis on tweets pre filtered for highimpact twitter users      shows results for similar analysis for high impact tweet
content      shows results for mixing both high impact user and high impact keyword
content techniques

 happy u  sad u represents sentiment value generated from high impact

 happy w  sad w represents sentiment value generated from high impact
tweet content
 liblinear and libsvm are svm libraries
 for libsvm  i omitted the results of    fold and    fold cross validation
and only kept the loocv results

fiupon performing logistic analysis on a variety of flavors of sentiment and
outcome based models  we found that for high impact user models  high impact
keyword content models and for combined models  the best sentiment model was
model    d  which predicts djia t  based on independent variables happy u t  
sad u t   happy w t   sad w t   happy u t     sad u t     happy w t    
sad w t     happy u t     sad u t     happy w t     and sad w t    
using this model in conjunction with svm and leave one out cross
validation  we achieved our greatest predictive power         for high impact user
models  for this combined model  this implies that applying time series instruments
on previous day close djia close and sentiment is significant in boosting next day
predictive power  see figures below for detailed results 
all models in each model type performed similar with ranges of no greater
than    in performance  high impact user model performed on the whole better than
high impact keyword models  with a mix of the two performing better than either or
in isolation  in addition  because our data for the time period      trading days  is
scarce  we just focused on the loocv result 
    high impact user results
the following tables show the results from using high impact user tweet filtering
technique and applying logistic regression and svm with linear  sigmoid and radial
kernels on the resulting sentiment  we used a variety of flavors of happy sad djiaprevious outcome to model djia outcome  and we collected results from   different
models with different lags  the best model was model   
djia t      happy u t    sad u t    happy u t      sad u t     
djia t  
using svm with a linear kernel  which achieved predictive power of           the

fi    high impact tweet content results
with the same idea as in      we obtain results from filtering tweets by high impact
content keywords  we performed similar analyses using logistic regression and
svm with linear  radial and sigmoid kernels  along with    fold     fold and leaveone out cross validation techniques  the best results came from model   
djia t      happy w t    sad w t    happy w t      sad w t     
happy w t      sad w t    
using svm with a linear kernel and cross validation  the results of models based on
data filtered by high impact tweet content are not as significant as those in      this
achieved predictive power of is           the results of our best model is listed

    combined user content model results
finally  we combined the high impact user and high impact keyword content models
from     and      using the same modeling techniques  the best results again came
from time series model   
djia t      happy u t    sad u t    happy w t    sad w t   
happy u t      sad u t      happy w t      sad w t      happy u t

fi   conclusion
we achieved modest results in our models  with models based on high impact
users achieving slightly greater predictive power relative to models based on highimpact finance related keywords  and combined modeling achieving greater
predictive power than either in isolation  both individual models achieved between
       predictive power  which combined modeling peaking at         while  we
were unable to match bollens results of        given the lack of public availability
of the sentiment algorithm used by bollen  our results were significant in showing
that combining both high impact user modeling and high impact keyword content
modeling and noteworthy techniques in processing twitter sentiment  we also
conclude that including time series instruments for previous changes in the market
improved predictive power  if we can have more data  a multinomial classification
will give more useful results 
however  by jack sparrow      my best trader makes money only    percent
of the time  most traders make money only in the    to    percent range  that means
youre going to be wrong a lot  our project focuses on the market performance
influenced by market sentiment  and gives us a good prediction         accuracy  of
the market in the short term  compared to the above statistic 
in addition  our project is not trying to build a trading strategy  but to establish
a fundamental market prediction model  which can be widely applied  after the
project  we may add other financial indices to our model and make it a trading
strategy  in addition  our result can be applied in different researches and strategies
related to financial market 
further analysis would involve applying more advanced linguistic analysis
techniques to better measure sentiment for twitter content and apply those
preprocessing techniques to our model for sentiment based stock market prediction
