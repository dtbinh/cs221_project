abstract
learning systems based automated proposal evaluation can
protect the public procurement agencies and funds from
fraud  corruption  unusual  and callas proposal evaluations by
evaluators  the impact on the economy from such system is
significant  savings can be in hundreds of billions of dollars
across the whole world 
research suggests that the objective evaluation of a
proposal received in response to a request for proposal
 rfp  is heavily influenced by evaluators expertise 
experience  and knowledge domain  evaluating proposal
from proposers is not easy  among other challenges 
evaluators have to balance objective evaluation decisions
against project usability objectives  specific criteria set by
the procurement agency  and account for the increasingly
diverse range of alternative technical approaches available 
intelligent proposal evaluation support systems are a
potential solution to this problem  they can eventually
become automated proposal evaluation systems  however 
to intelligently assist evaluators in evaluating proposals 
computer systems need to possess computable
representations of human readable proposals in text  using
machine extracted text based features and evaluation
judgments from    evaluators on    proposals  we present
preliminary results based on established methodology that
suggest that such representation may be possible  this is
the first step towards realization of a learning systems
based automated proposal evaluation system 
introduction and motivation
sysoft erfp  a group decision support system
 http   erfp sysoft com  helps government  and corporate
procurement agencies evaluate proposals in response to a
request for proposal  rfp       the system is used all over
us and abroad for small  medium  and large scale complex
procurement projects where best value is desired instead of
lowest cost  the procurement projects include it systems 
defense
systems 
construction
projects 
service
procurements like security services  commercial aviation

cargo handling and many more  the scale of procurement
ranges from hundreds of thousands of dollars to multi billion
dollar systems procurement 
the current version of erfp uses multiple human evaluators
to evaluate proposals against specific criteria and evaluation
guiding rules  the system collects all the scores and
comments from all evaluators  and provides a report based on
scores and evaluator comments  it is a two step process 
first  proposals are shortlisted as acceptable or unacceptable 
in the second step  top proposal is chosen for contract award 
one substantial enhancement request from the clients of
sysoft erfp is to assist the human evaluators with machine
learning system that can guide human evaluators evaluate
these proposals  eventually it is desired that these human
evaluators be replaced by the learning system enhancing the
speed of evaluation and productivity  in addition  for some
large and real complex procurement efforts  the machine
learning system can be used to validate human agent based
evaluation and act as quick and simple audit system to
protect the public agencies and funds from fraud  corruption 
unusual  and callas proposal evaluations by evaluators 
every procurement entity evaluates proposals in slightly
different manner  the criteria are also different depending on
the rfp  interestingly  industry norm is to provide some rule
based objective guidance rules and recommendations for
evaluators to evaluate these proposals  the rules can be as
simple as  look for the word  neurogenesis  and see how
many times used   as mentioned  these rules differ from one
procurement agency to another and sometimes are dependent
on federal state local laws and internationally country
specific laws  this is the reason why the learning system may
be specific to a procurement entity  eventually it may be
possible to build a software configurator for tuning the
specific attributes of the learning system to suit different
agencies and rfp types in the future  this will make the
system universal for all procurement usage 
evaluating proposals from proposers is challenging for
many reasons  evaluators have to balance objective
evaluation decisions against project usability objectives 
specific criteria set by the procurement agency  and account
for the increasingly diverse range of alternative technical
approaches available in response to rfps      a potential
solution to this problem is intelligent proposal evaluation
support tools that can assist in proposal evaluation  these
tools should be able to validate manual evaluations by
human agents  however  in order to achieve this goal  such
systems must have the capacity to represent proposal

 

fievaluation attributes in a computable form  erfp proposal
evaluation system should be able to represent human
evaluation judgments in terms of variables in the evaluation
space 
using machine extracted proposal evaluation
attributes from text based features and evaluation
judgments of    human evaluators on    proposals  we
present preliminary results based on established
methodologies that suggest that such representation may be
possible      this is the first step towards realization of a
learning systems based automated proposal evaluation
system 
in the remainder of this paper we summarize prior work in
the area of statistical learning of criteria based appeal for
proposals  we then describe the process of data collection
and an experiment to investigate the possibility of
representing proposal evaluation attributes for human
readable textual proposals in a computable form  we
conclude with a discussion of our findings and
recommendations for future work in this technical area 
previous work
previous research has demonstrated that automatic text
summarization based on word clusters and ranking
algorithms allows one to adapt summaries to the user needs
and to the corpus characteristics      a review of the theory
and methods of document classification and text mining 
focusing on the existing literature shows possibilities of
computable representations of human readable proposals in
text     the authors of the aforementioned work suggest
that it is possible to develop computer algorithms that can
deliver quick and dirty evaluations of subjective aspects of
any text based proposal  however  neither of these papers
conclusively proves that proposal evaluation attributes can
be represented in computable form 
we extend this previous research in a few significant and
novel ways  first  we learn statistical models for predicting
proposal evaluation attributes in terms of text based features
which have already been employed in text mining
applications 
these text based features describe a
proposals use of fundamental corpus statistics  word
frequencies  co occurrences  measure of point wise mutual
information for dependences between words  and word cooccurrences at shorter distances with word order      they
are informed by procurement agencys evaluation guidelines
and evaluation subject matter experts  smes   next  we
employ performance evaluation to demonstrate that it may
be possible for text based feature models to learn and
represent proposal evaluation attributes in a computable
form 

computation and data aceess platform
the biggest challenge has been preparing the data for learning
and testing  one specific procurement agency was selected
for developing and testing prototype machine learning system
that can evaluate the proposals based on responses from

word frequencies

co occurrences

measure of point wise
mutual information for
dependences between words

word co occurrences at

figure    our statistical models to predict proposal evaluation
appeal were built using text based features  these text based
features are informed by interviews with subject matter expert
evaluators  and evaluation guidelines from the procurement
agency 

vendors and proposal evaluation guidelines set by the
procurement agency  the responses are in free text format
 unstructured data  but the evaluation guidelines are quite
structured and objective  sysoft erfp is capable of capturing
data on criteria  vendor responses  evaluation scores  and
evaluation comments from evaluators who never evaluated
these rfps     
sysoft erfp works with oracle and sql server  the
database was segmented and replicated into ms access with
more than two hundred tables  matlab computing
environment was connected to the database through matlab
jdbc odbc relational database connector  the data was
readily available to matlab computing environment through
structured query language commands to the database from
matlab code 
this made the computing and testing
environment very compact and productive in a laptop running
matlab with ms access 
experiment
we conducted an experiment to investigate whether textbased feature models can reliably learn and predict proposal
evaluation attributes on    proposals from two domains of
proposal sets  rfp  and rfp    rfp  was procurements
of telephone systems for special situations  rfp  was
procurement of genome analyzers for hospital patients 
both rfps belong to the same procurement agency 
specifically  we formulated the following two hypotheses 
h   text based feature models can reliably learn proposal
evaluation attributes for a set of evaluations in the rfp 
domain
h   text based feature models that are learned on the rfp 
domain can make reliable predictions on the rfp  domain 
proposal evaluation judgment refers to the objective
evaluation opinion collected from the evaluators  proposal
evaluation attributes refer to the phenomenon that we are
trying to learn and represent in a computable form 
collecting criteria based appeal judgments
data set of proposals
rfp  received    proposals from various vendors  rfp  
received    proposals from some other vendors  the same
   evaluators evaluated all the    proposals 
the

 

fievaluation criteria for both proposals were  how
technically competent is this proposal in a scale of   to     
  being worst and     being best  evaluation data was
captured in sysoft erfp system  the proposals were
submitted in text format by the vendors through the sysoft
erfp online proposal submission system  the evaluators
were able to access the proposals via the erfp evaluation
interface that they are familiar with        the evaluators
evaluated the proposals based on the selected criteria  sysoft
erfp automatically rank ordered these proposals for each
evaluator based on their scores  the process was repeated
for the    proposals from rfp  domain and then the   
proposals from rfp  domain 
proposal evaluators
sixteen evaluators from one procurement agency
participated in this experiment  none of these evaluators
had any affiliation with the vendors who submitted the
proposals  their contribution of effort and time was
compensated by the volunteering procurement agency 
none of these evaluators evaluated proposals of rfp  or
rfp  before 

figure    proposals entered in erfp system

procedure
we designed a two phase erfp based rank ordering
experiment for measuring the proposal evaluation
judgments  before starting the experiment  evaluators were
told to evaluate these proposals like any other evaluation
project and were given standard time to evaluate these
proposals  evaluators were informed that they will evaluate
first the    proposals for rfp domain in the sysoft erfp
evaluation interface and then repeat the same process for
the next    proposals in rfp domain 
time limits were set for this experiment from previous
similar projects completed in the same procurement agency 
evaluator used standard procurement agency guidelines

analysis
  clustering criteria based appeal judgments at group level
we applied k means on the median and standard deviation
of rank positions of each proposal from the erfp database to
generate shortlisted clusters of acceptable and
unacceptable proposals at the group level  the median
rank of a proposal represents its degree of criteria based
evaluation appeal at the group level  the standard deviation
represents the level of agreement within the group about the
criteria based evaluation appeal  conceptually  a proposal
with high median rank and relatively large standard deviation
is considered an unacceptable proposal with low group
level agreement  while a proposal with low median rank
and low standard deviation is considered an acceptable
proposal with high group level agreement  established
methodologies were used to perform this analysis     

 

fi   model building and statistical testing
after generating group level  binary  labels  called
shortlisting in procurement methodologies  we trained and
tested three types of supervised learning models  nave
bays     binary logistic regression     and linear kernel
support vector machines      to test our hypothesis in
page    we evaluated each model using two measures of
performance 
a  within domain performance  h     leave one out
cross validation error on rfp  domain
b  transfer performance  h    test error on rfp 
domain of model trained on rfp  domain 
statistical confidence testing was performed on each
models performance measures because of small number of
examples in both domains  in other words  if and only if the
following null hypothesis could be rejected using a    
confidence level  p        a model is considered to have
learned group level proposal evaluation attributes with
statistically significant performance 
h   learned model error   model error of a model that
makes decisions by randomly flipping a coin

computationally viable k means with squared euclidian
distance was run until convergence  clustering in both
domains was linearly separable  squared distance made the
computation efficient and feasible  
in the rfp  domain   n      acceptable  shortlisted

figure    graphs manifest performance of the three
supervised learning models  performance on the rfp 
domain is depicted by the within domain graph 
performance of the models trained on rfp  domain and
tested on the rfp  domain is depicted by the across domain
graph  statistically significant performance is shown by the
svm model in within domain and across domain 

discussion
the standard deviation of cluster groups are comparable
along the dimensions of degree of criteria based proposal
evaluation appeal and group level agreement for both
domains  similar to other similar projects undertaken    
this observation suggests that k means provided a reliable
estimate of group level proposal evaluation judgments  and
furthermore that our analysis with binary labels was valid 
our result shows that a linear kernel svm has statistically
significant performance on both within  and across  domain

 

fimeasures  these results verify our experimental hypotheses
h  and h   page     furthermore false positive and false
negative rates also suggest that the model was finding
statistical structure of group level proposal evaluation
attributes in terms of text based features 
outcome
the results of this project has raised the interest level
among the sysoft erfp decision makers to the extent that
they have allocated funds to perform a twelve member
machine learning support project starting january      
this will allow us to continue working on the project 
conclusion and future work
we aimed to explore whether it was possible to express
proposal evaluation attributes in a computable form  the
finding from our experiment suggests that such
representation may be possible  the scope of this project
was limited because of time limit and lack of resource
allocation  the next step is to establish the findings from
our experiment at a much larger scale across many different
rfp domains and many procurement agencies across the
country and internationally 
in future  we plan to engineer and find applicability of the
following  advanced corpus statistics  statistical text
mining models  geometrical models  and dimensionality
reduction and other natural language processing  nlp 
techniques to enhance our models                  also 
we may use document categorization with unsupervised
clustering  supervised classification with vector and
probability space  content analysis with polarity
estimation  property estimation  and property extraction
