mature micrornas  mirna  are short      nucleotide   single stranded  noncoding rna strands that
regulate gene expression  mirna expression in tissues is increasingly used to classify cell states and show
promise as clinical biomarkers for diagnostics  in this report  we summarize our experience using three
different machine learning  ml  algorithms to classify mirna expression profiles in two distinct biological
models  in each case we use supervised learning and evaluate the performance of a given algorithm through
hold out validation  first we develop classifiers using mirna expression profiles from a variety of tissues
from mouse and human specimens with the goal of species classification  then we evaluate these classifiers
on the harder problem of cancer detection using a database of mirna expression profiles of cancerous and
normal breast tissue obtained by deep sequencing  by comparing and contrasting the performance of different
algorithms  we gained insight into the nuances of applying ml to the analysis of mirna expression profiles 
micrornas are small noncoding bits of the
genome that regulate gene expression and thus
influence cell state and phenotype  in this study 
we report on our findings from using mirna expression profiles as a biomarker for different biological classification problems

introduction

reliably detecting and classifying cell states is an important problem in cell biology  with applications in developmental biology and human health  since mirnas
are rapidly emerging as an important player in our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in cells  and
since gene expression controls many aspects of phenotype
and cell state  there is reason to infer that mirna expression profiles represent a compact biomarker  however 
at this stage  our knowledge of mirna and gene regulatory networks are incomplete and our measurements
of mirna expression profiles are noisy  furthermore 
since each mirna can regulate up to hundreds of genes 
it is not obvious that mirna expression profiles can be
naively used to classify cell states without additional biological information  hence the theme of the present
study  without large databases or additional biological
information  can microrna expression profiles alone be
used to classify cell states 
we approach this problem by studying two simple systems of increasing difficulty  the first is the classification
of species from mirna expression profiles of various tissues within a species  the second system is breast cancer
detection from a small labeled database of cancerous and
normal breast tissues

species classification

we downloaded the mirna expression levels from
a study  that investigated rna seq experiments on
a variety of tissues from different species  the data

getdownloads do as relative expression levels within
given data sets  we restricted our study to the human and
mouse data with the goal of correctly classifying species
from supervised learning on mirna expression levels 
we constructed attribute vectors from the expression
data by intersecting the mirnas that were measured for
both species to construct vectors  indexed by mirna
type  of real numbers that give the relative expression
level  we tested three machine learning algorithms and
found that reliable species classification is possible

svm with a gaussian kernel

in order to study the quality of classification with a
standard support vector machine  svm  algorithm  we
used the libsvm library    this library solves the following
optimization problem 
l

min

fig     decrease in average error as the ratio of data used
in training set is increased  it is important to note that the
number of human species data points used in the training set
was limited by the number of mouse data in order to mitigate
the bias from the prior 

a 

naive bayes

a naive bayes classifier was implemented as an initial
attempt to classify the mirna profiles  the validity of
the naive bayes assumption is certainly in question and
at best a rough approximation  however  given that the
genetic species identifiers across many tissues are likely to
be uncorrelated  and that only a few hundred microrna
regulate thousands of genes  we dont expect too much
conditional dependence between the micrornas 
the first version of the naive bayes that we implemented was straightforward  using laplace smoothing
and logarithmic mapping of the posterior function to prevent underflow  the first set of results with hold out
ratio  the fraction of data saved for the test set  of    
yielded an error of         however  since there was
  x human tissue examples in the training set than
mouse tissue examples  the prior p human         had
a large enough effect on the prediction to classify all of
the tissues in the test set as human  the validity of using
naive bayes is not just based on the on the conditional
independence of the random variables  but also depends
upon having a reasonable prior  in this context  the prior
doesnt make sense since the amount of training examples of a particular species doesnt predict the amount
in the testing set   or at least we dont have reason to
assume this  we adjusted the algorithm to effeectively
remove the prior  essentially turning it into a maximum
likelihood method  which slighly improved the results 
we also extended naive bayes to use cross validation
and kept the ratio of human to mouse tissues in the randomly generated training matrix constant at      the
algorithm randomly selected a fraction of the data and
was run   times for x                         figure     the
results show significant improvement in error as the holdout ratio is decreased  building the training matrix with
    of the available mouse tissues examples and the same
amount of human examples  the naive bayes implementation correctly classified     of the test set on average 
using the known labels  we evaluated the strongest informal species indicators by comparing the conditional
probabilities of observing different mirna  these indicators are omitted for brevity

we found that the gaussian kernel or radial basis function  rbf  performed the best in initial trials and is recommended by the authors of the library in their online
guide  as the starting point for the application of svm to
general datasets  the rbf is paramaterized by a single
parameter  and is defined as follows 
 

k xi   xj     e  xi xj           

   

since we were able to achieve excellent results with this
kernel  it is the focus of our study  in their guide  the authors of the library recommend linearly scaling the data
so that each component of the attribute vector xi is in
the interval         although the authors advocate this
procedure and demonstrated its effectiveness on several
datasets  we observed the opposite effect in our data  it
reduced the accuracy by about      this is likely in part
due to the fact that the data was scaled in a biologically
meaningful way and thus altering the scaling diminishes
the information content of the data 
another problem with this approach to scaling the
data is that it gives all of the mirna equal weight  since
mirna expression levels can be viewed approximately as
a two state system  either on or off   then normalizing
the data in this way has the potential to turn mirna in
the off state into the on state by amplifying biological
and machine noise  we can clearly see in figure   that
both species share overlapping regions of mirna which
have low expression levels 
the algorithm as described requires two parameters
which we searched for via grid search and k fold crossvalidation  figure     using this approach  we were able
to consistently predict species labels with      accuracy over a broad range of parameters  indicating robust
algorithm performance 

c 

modeling mirna data as a poisson distribution

while the gaussian kernel svm yields excellent results  it is based on a continuous distribution model 
our data  however  are actually from discrete counts acquired from rna sequencers  we therefore implemented
a model  that uses a more realistic poisson distribution 

fifinal write up

 

fig     grid search results over parameters c  y axis  and
  x axis  using k fold cross validation  k      colorbar indicates accuracy of prediction  steps are in increments of  x  
where x is the axis tick  note that reliable predictions persist
over large parameters ranges 

in the implemented method  we have xij 
poisson nij    where nij   si gj   here  xij is the number of reads mapped from the sample i  of n  to the
feature j  of p   si is the constant scaling factor from
the ith sample  which can be quite variable due to noise
in the rna sequencers   and gi represents how often
the jth feature is mapped relative to the other features 
a natural extension proposed in this model is given as
xij  yi   k  poisson nij dkj    where nij   si gj   where k
represents the classification of a given sample  ie  malignant vs benign tumors  species  etc    dkj is the parameter
that allows for features to be expressed differently based
on its class  and y represents the classification 
due to the highly variable nature of si   the method of
estimating  or effectively normalizing the ith row of x 
has the potential to drastically affect classification  this
is particularly true when a small number of features are
much larger than the others and have noticeable variability  three methods were proposed for estimating si
to normalize the ith sample     total count method  dividing the sum of the ith row of x by the sum of all the elements in x      the median ratio  finding the weighted
median of all features in the ith row  divided by the sum
of the medians from all other rows   and    the quantile method  finding the   th percentile for the ith row
and dividing it by the   th percentile for all rows   after
using training data to compute si   gj  which multiplied
provide nij    and dkj   the test data is then normalized
using each of the three methods above  the log of the
conditional distribution is then given as 
log p  y    k x    

p
x
j  

xj log dkj  s

p
x

gj dkj

   

  log p  y   k    c

   

j  

the model then classifies the test data x to be the class
for which log p  y    k x   is largest  we also experimented with soft thresholding as discussed in the paper

fig     the error rates for the three normalization techniques
used in our poisson model are shown above  we clearly see
that the median ratio method has significantly less error than
the other methods 

without substantial impact upon the results 
we note that we set p  y   k        even though
that wasnt reflected in our test data  this was done to
prevent bias as we wanted to test data that did have an
equal distribution of humans and mice 
figure   shows the error for each normalization method
versus the ratio of mice data used in the training set
 with the number of human samples being the same as
the number of mice samples   all other data was then
tested  these points were calculated by taking     iterations of randomly selected samples for each ratio of
data  the plots clearly show the superior performance
of the median ratio when compared to the other methods  this was not expected  as the data presented with
the model  showed very little variation based on normalization method  we believe that our results differ
because the data were pre normalized since the sum of
the mirna across the ssample was unity  this is inconsistent with the poisson model and therefore led to
divergent results 

iii 

cancer data

we downloaded the data from a deep sequencing study
of breast cancer    this data has several important differences compared to the species data  it is highly imbalanced with respect to the two classes  with only   
normal tissue samples compared to     invasive breast
carcinoma samples  the ratio of the two sample sizes differs by a factor of almost     furthermore this data was
unscaled and thus a scaling method had to be chosen 
although accuracy is an important quality measure  especially for comparision to the species study  it is not
ideal in this case  due to the imbalance of the sizes of
the data sets  it is possible for the model to predict that
everything is cancer and obtain a high accuracy rate 
we therefore analyzed false positives as well as false negatives  in a hypothetical clinical situation  we imagine
that false negative would be the quality measure that
carried the most weight  finally  the imbalance in the
size of the classes and the large number of carcinoma

samples made k fold cross validation impractical  hence
we used hold out random sampling to test the different
algorithms 

fig     this plot shows the correlation between the mirnas
mutual information value and its total number of counts in
the data set  there is a clear trend indicating that the mirna
that are more represented in the data set are of greater value
for cancer classification  the slope of the linear fit to the logscaled data is       which means that mi mirnaj    n    
 
j

in order to analyze the informational content of the
data  we used the feature selection approach of mutual
information  assigning relative values to each mirna
feature  which represented the correlation between the
mirna and the cancer state  there was a definite trend
between the number of mirna counts in the data and
the informational value of the mirna features  figure    
the slope of the linear fit to the log scaled data was      
which means that  if we denote the number of counts
for the jth mirna as nj   then the mutual information
mi is roughly proportional to n    
  the majority of
j
the mirna had mi values extremely close to zero  corresponding to a negligible correlation or divergence  we
were able to apply our findings from this mutual information analysis by only including mirna with significant
counts in the data  i e  the top     out of        
we ran the same modified implementation of naive
bayes developed with the species data on the cancer
data set  the same algorithm yielded much worse performance on the cancer data  the maximum average accuracy ranged from     with a hold out ratio of     to
    with a hold out ratio of      this decrease in performance may be due to a lack of normal tissue data  as
well as the increased correlation between the mirna behavior in these carcinogenic and normal human tissues 
in contrast to the species classification problem  where
we had reason to assume conditional independence between the mirna levels that differentiated species  here
it seems likely that the mirna involved in tumorigenesis
are conditionally correlated  this invalidates the naive
bayes assumption and explains the poor performance of
that algorithm on these data 

fig     a  c  grid search over svm parameters using three
different quality measures  note that there is not overlap between minima  the quality landscape is much more rough
compared to the species data  d  the false negative rate
shows improvement with increasing training set size  as well
as concomitant improvement in the other measures  the dip
in the accuracy illustrates the difficulty associated with the
non overlapping landscapes  the values plotted are for the
parameters that optimized the false negative rate only 

a 

svm with a gaussian kernel

significant differences to the species classification problem were observed with the gaussian kernel svm  the
most obvious difference is the decline in the peformance
across all measures  in figure    we observe that the
exponentially varying parameter space is not only more
sensitive to parameter values but also noisier   that is 
small changes in parameter values cause abrupt changes
in quality  in contrast to the species classification problem  which was insensitive with respect to the regularization parameter  c   the cancer data showed much more
variation  this suggests that the cancer data is not as
well separated as the species data 
perhaps the most significant feature of the grid parameter search is the non overlapping minima of the different
quality measures  minimization of  say  the false negatives does not yield an optimal value for the false positives  the second observation is that all of the measures
were sensitive to the data partitioning between training
and testing sets  we used     random samples for each
pixel in the grid search to reduce sampling noise  but the
variation between samples was substantial  which suggests a need for larger datasets  we experimented with
significantly unequal numbers of class representatives in
the training data to compensate for the small number
of normal tissue representatives  but this decreased performance  performance also decreased  and computa

tion time significantly increased  when we used all of the
mirna features  following the mi analysis  all results
shown used only the     most prominant mirna 
finally  we note the declining rate of false negatives

used only had ten representatives from each tissue type 
the false negative rate of      is quite promising 

 
more closely modelled by a poisson distribution 
for both analyses  the same number of cancer and normal tissues were randomly chosen for both training and
testing  thus removing the possibility that misclassifying
normal tissue would have little effect on the displayed accuracy  furthermore      iterations were performed for
each parameter value to reduce noise  the classification
analysis performed here shows that the poisson classification method performs quite well for the amount of
training data and would presumably continue to improve
with more data 

conclusion   outlook

fig     a  here we visualize the poisson cancer classification
error verses the number of mirna used for classification  we
see that the number of rna samples used can have a significant impact on the classification  with some normalization
methods even getting worse when all mirna are used  b

training samples used for each cancer and normal tissue  here
we see that the normalization method had little effect on the
classification accuracy

poisson model

we performed cancer classification by supervised learning while modeling the data as a poisson distribution
as with the species data  figure   a shows the cancer
classification error versus the number of most prominent
mirna used in classification  it is interesting to note
that the performance deteriorated significantly when we
included all of the mirna for the median ratio normalization method  this is consistent with the mi analysis 
figure   b shows the poisson cancer classification error
as a function of the training samples used when considering only the     most prominent mirna  here we see
little difference between normalization techniques  especially as the number of training samples increases  this
is consistent with the findings in      but is in contrast
to the species classification where the median ratio normalization was significantly better than the other techniques  we believe this is because the cancer data were
not normalized in advance  which allowed them to be

we began this study with the goal of understanding
how to apply ml to the classification of cell states by
mirna expression profiles  by beginning with a simple
system  the classification of distinct species from various
tissue profiles  we encountered the main issues that persisted throughout our investigation  the species analysis
demonstrated that the ratio of species in the training
data had a significant impact on the performance of all
three classification algorithms  we found that by constructing a training set with a     ratio of species  each
algorithm performed better  this observation proved
useful in the cancer detection problem where the same
approach improved our results 
our analysis showed that while cancer detection using
mirna samples is promising  it is significantly harder
than species differentiation  this is consistent with the
intuition that the underlying biological difference between two species should be greater than a given tissue in
a normal and disease state  additionally  the relatively
small size of the normal breast tissue data limited our
ability to train the classifiers 
while our results were promising  it is likely that they
can be improved with more data and by incorporating additional biological knowledge  such as correlating mirna
abundance with other biological markers to construct
more detailed cell state fingerprints  in conclusion  we
found that mirna expression profiles are surprisingly
flexible biomarkers and  in combination with ml tools 
can characterize cell states across dramatically different biological models without significant prior biological
knowledge or extensive datasets
