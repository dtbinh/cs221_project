abstract
the basic aim of this project is to provide a machine learning model to explain the strength
of us dollar  support vector machine  svm  is a promising method for the analysis of financial time series which we employ  macroeconomic factors of fundamental analysis are selected
as the features of the model  the learning results and out of sample test show that svm
provides a good performance to us dollar index analysis while the gaussian kernel is the
best through the cross validation process  furthermore  feature selection is discussed  while
cpi and pmi are the most significant features in assumption of gaussian kernel

introduction
a financial time series is a sequence of data points  measured typically at successive points in
time spaced at uniform time intervals  examples of time series are the daily closing value of the
dow jones industrial average  the distribution of financial time series is changing over the time 
modeling such dynamical and non stationary time series is expected to be a challenging task 
basically  the svm maps the inputs into a higher dimensional feature space in which a linear
classifier is constructed by minimizing an appropriate cost function  using mercers theorem  the
solution is obtained by solving a dual problem avoiding explicit knowledge of the high dimension
and using only the related kernel function  this project applies svm to financial time series
analysis of us dollars index  in addition  this paper examines the features of both fundamental
analysis and technical analysis 
there are some researches which show that svm is a powerful tool for financial analysis  kamruzzaman et al         investigated the effect of different kernel functions  namely  linear  polynomial 
radial basis and spline on prediction error of svm models for foreign currency exchange rates 
nakamori et al         use svm method in predicting financial movement direction of nikkei
    index     zhou  ongsritrakul and soonthornphisaj        demonstrated the use of support
vector regression techniques for predicting the cost of gold by using factors that have an effect
on gold to estimate its price 

support vector machines
recently  a support vector machine  svm   a novel neural network algorithm  was developed by
vapnik and his colleagues     svm uses linear model to implement nonlinear class boundaries
through some non  linear mapping the input vectors into the high dimensional feature space 
therefore  svm is known as the algorithm that finds a special kind of linear model  the maximum margin hyperplane  which gives the maximum separation between the decision classes  the
training examples that are closest to the maximum margin hyperplane are called support vectors  all other training examples are irrelevant for defining the binary class boundaries     the
mathematical problem is constructed as follows

      in cases which are linearly separable  left figure below   while      in cases not
linearly separable  right figure below   where examples are allowed to have functional margin
less than   

 if the transformation is nonlinear and the dimensionality of the feature space is high enough 
then input space may be transformed into a new feature space where the patterns are linearly
separable with high probability     this nonlinear transformation is performed in implicit
way through so called kernel functions 

data
five features deriving from fundamental analysis are selected out in the svm model  all of them
have significant effect on the price of us dollar 
 us dollar index   usd strength
the usd index measures the performance of the us dollar against a basket of currencies 
eur  jpy  gbp  cad  chf and sek  we label a monthly index increase as    while a
decrease as   to train the following features 
 libor   interest rate
the biggest influence that drives the foreign exchange market is interest rate  generally
speaking  a higher interest rate results in stronger currency and vice versa  a surprise of
 

fiinterest rate driven by the central bank or the market can affect the foreign exchange market
in a great deal  there is also an equation known as interest rate parity 
forward rate   spot rate       interest rate of overseas country       interest rate of
domestic country 
 cpi   inflation rate
inflation rate have opposite effect on foreign exchange rate  i e   as a general rule  a country
with a consistently lower inflation rate exhibits a rising currency value  as its purchasing
power increases relative to other currencies  consumer price index  cpi    a measure of price
changes in consumer goods and services such as gasoline  food  clothing and automobiles 
this index is viewed as a common measure for inflation rate 
 gdp   economics growth
no doubt  foreign investors seek for stable countries with strong economic performance in
which to invest their capital  a country with such positive attributes will draw investment
funds and hence result in stronger currency  and gdp is widely used as an index to measure
a countrys economic performance 
 pmi   leading economic indicator
financial market players have their own view of the future  which drive their investment
decisions in the market  so pmi  which is viewed as a leading indicator of the economics 
has a similar role like gdp in foreign exchange market  what is more  pmi is considered a
leading indicator in the eyes of the fed  who has dominant power in the market with their
monetary policies 
 unemployment rate   labor market
labor market is considered by fed in their policy making  too  is it generally accepted that
high employment is one of the goals of central bank when making monetary policy 
figure   shows the scaled time series of our training data  the orange line is the scaled us dollar
index measuring the performance of the us dollar against a basket of currencies like eur  jpy 
gbp  etc  the time series are from jan      to dec      monthly

ficross validation
we use hold out cross validation to randomly split all sample into training sample        of the
data  and testing sample        of the data   then we fit different kernel svm to training and
test their training error and generalization error as follows 
training error   
gaussian
polynomial
linear
quadratic

mean
          
          
          
          

standard deviation

min
          
          
          
          

table    cross validation training error
gaussian and polynomial have the least training error  the good performance of gaussian is
natural  and we want to point out that polynomial kernel tends to be overfitting  so we need
further research on its generalization error

table    cross validation generalization error

figure    training   generalization error in gaussian  linear  quadratic and polynomial kernels
generalization error of each kernel is not ideal  but we prove in next chapter that gaussian
out of sample test has good result  a explanation of this seemingly contradiction is that simple
cross validation randomly split the sample into two groups  and this method is likely to destroy
the property of time series  for instance  the training sample may have points in future  but
testing sample may be constituted of many past points  despite the defect mentioned above  cross
validation is a good way to prove that gaussian kernel has a relatively balanced and acceptable
performance in both training and generalization error  which is exactly what we need 

out of sample test
we use the latest    months to test the prediction ability of svm model  results of different
kernels are as follows 
 

fiout of sample test
error

gaussian
   

polynomial
   

linear
   

quadratic
   

the result shows that gaussian kernel has the best prediction ability  i e  minimum generalization
error   the error is      which means our model is acceptable 

feature selection reduction analysis
in this section  feature selection procedure is discussed  it is important and interesting to know
which feature is more significant to help predict the usd strength and which one contribute more
to the accuracy in the model  through the component analysis  we found that different kernel
functions gave different weight that each feature contribute to the training accuracy  since we
have justified the optimality of gaussian kernel in previous section  we will discuss the component
analysis in gaussian kernel assumption  table   below shows the results of the backward selection
of the features with loss of training accuracy in each iteration with deleting each single feature

as the table shows  the significance of features is in order of 
cpi   pmi   gdp   libor   unemployment rate  when one feature is removed  unemployment rate gives the least loss of accuracy with       for training data  therefore    features with
unemployment rate deleted provide       accuracy  which is already a very good proxy for the full
set of features learning  furthermore  cpi  pmi and gdp are the most significant features providing        of accuracy  although it loses       of accuracy when removing libors contribution 
interestingly  cpi  the most significant feature itself gives training accuracy of       

conclusion   further discussion
svm approach for usd strength analysis has good performance when gaussian kernel is employed 
which is verified by cross validation procedure  while   selected macroeconomic features give    
error in out of sample test  moreover  cpi and pmi are found to be the most significant features
through component analysis  further discussion includes whether adding in other indigenous
economic features and their technical analysis will yield better performance  features of economic
data in eurozone and japan should be analyzed as usd index measure the strength against the
currency in such economies  in which scenario  more accurate time filtration must be constructed
