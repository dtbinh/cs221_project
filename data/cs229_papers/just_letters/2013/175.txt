identifying threats in diplomatic  
correspondence

data

several organizations including the united states
government have initiated projects to digitize declassified diplomatic documents   for this project 
we scrape the united states department of state
office of the historians foreign relations of the
united states  frus  collection  which archives
significant intra government documents from     
to        the vast majority of the documents are
internal memos sent within the cabinet and with
american diplomatic outposts

introduction

the frus in total is too large and varied in topics
to cover at once  as such  we focus on a couple important issue areas  cold war germany
and cuba  including the cuban missile crisis  
each topic covers several volumes of the frus 
germany berlin involves       documents  while
      exist on cuba 

since the inception of the field  international relations  hereafter ir  scholars have placed substantial emphasis on the importance of threats
and credibility in explaining interstate behavior
especially in the midst of crises that may precipitate armed conflict  countless studies of theoretical  historical  and formal flavors have been devoted to the study of threat perception  jervis
      sartori       stein        empirical studies that actually measure and evaluate perceived
threat  on the other hand  have been lacking  the
paucity of micro level data has hampered analysis
on the use and effectiveness of threats  ir academics have long recognized this shortcoming but
been unable to address it  some recent studies
have used laboratory experiments to assess threat
perception within the general public  rousseau
and garcia retamero        but much of this research fails to explain actual policy decisions by
governmental elites  to better understand threat
perception  the ir field requires new empirical approaches that capture this elusive but crucial concept in a large scale and systematic way  machine
learning may resolve this 

in order to perform the desired analysis  we
split each memo into tokens and sentences  using pythons nltk package  specifically  corpus
for removing stop words and porterstemmer for
lemmatizing   stop words were also removed from
the dictionary  a general summary of four collections of memos we scraped is in table    for
this project  and for historical reasons beyond the
scope of this short update  we focus on the germany berlin collection

nary categorizations of whether or not a sentence
contains threatening language    or    respectively    for our purposes  and especially given
the internal nature of the memos  here we focus on
language that reveals perception of external threat 
we provide a couple examples below  while our
classifications were done using randomly chosen 
unconnected sentences  these examples use whole
paragraphs in order to better show the contrast between threatening and non threatening language 

the data  we only limit ourselves to tokens that
occur at least twice in the corpus of documents  
this sample hence contained       unique nonstop tokens 

 the military are worried about the general
attitude in europe    there has been a let up
on the ground that the threat is not as great
as it was assumed to be    from our viewpoint
the ussrs capability is still there  we have
no way of knowing what soviet intentions are 
  initially  our problem was one of encouragement and of laying out the general outline of
a plan for european defense  

a bag of words approach is taken throughout 
we first implement bernoulli naive bayes  nb 
with laplace smoothing on the data  k fold  with
k       cross validation is used to leverage the
data  the model yields an average accuracy rate
of        with standard deviation       

for the purposes of this report  we classified      
unique and randomly drawn sentences       or
about     were found to expressed perceived
threat  this data was then converted into the
appropriate token frequency matrix  however  to
limit some noise and to slightly reduce the size of

   fold cross validation shows an average accuracy
rate of        with standard deviation        as
such  svm seems to perform better than the nb
implementation

tokens like soviet  would   the  could  said  and
the like  appears to gauge informativeness based
on frequency or basic existence in the sentence 
those tokens are fourth  first  second  tenth  and

 
we considered doing a multinomial classification based
on varying degrees of threats  however  given that this is
the first pass at a novel research agenda  we erred on the side
of conservatism and decided on a binary approach  instead

cross validation indicated that this threshold at   performs better than other potential values 
 
results that do not account for unbalanced data are
markedly worse and not worth reporting if they are to be
immediately discarded

berlin germany data using svm  calculations done
using holdout cross validation with a standard      
split  k fold cross validation is not used due to computational time constraints 

increases in figure   may not be as troubling as
it first seems  the low test error at small m is
due to high numbers of false negatives  indeed 
when m        the nb classifier predicts no perceived threats in the test data  and all test error comes from failing to identify  s  both nb
and svm have improved recall with more data 
though nb has noticeably worse performance  in
our trials  nbs recall never exceeds       while
svms reaches            with large training sets
and would likely continue to improve with more
data  svm also has higher precision than nb 
the former wanders between      and       while
the latter never exceeds      overall  nb underidentifies threats and is often incorrect when doing
so  probably related to its less convincing identification of influential tokens   svm appears more
effective  finding both a reasonable number of sentences as threats while also being more effective 
we further summarize these results by calculating
the balanced f  score for each test  and present
these statistics in figure    we openly admit that
while svms results are better  they are not ob

sources of error

figure   displays training and test errors for the
nb and svm implementations above  training
and test error do not greatly change as the number
of sentences in the training data  m  grows  one
potential exception is svm training error  which
rises as a consequence of the model perfectly classifying threats in the much smaller training sets 
given the small percentage of threats in the sample
data  there may be some concern that the models
high accuracy comes from blindly classifying all
test data as being  that is  predominantly
from false negatives  we therefore examine precision and recall for both nb and svm  an attempt
to graphically represent these changes over training data size is presented in figure    the proportion of blue to red in each bar represents precision 
while the proportion of blue to the horizontal line

the results of this paper suggest that machine
learning techniques can indeed help us systemati 

data preprocessing already involved the removal
of stop words  however  we may seek to take into
account the relatively frequency of another subset of tokens that are not stop words yet also not
highly informative in classification  we therefore

 

another extension considered was the use of n grams
 specifically bi grams and tri grams   neither approach improved results
