abstract
current therapeutic modalities in radiation therapy such as static field imrt and rotational single arc
vmat are more oriented to either the plan quality or the delivery efficiency  recently  fusion arc
treatment scheme has been proposed by combining the advantages of two respective modalities  the
basic structure is to deliver the dose with rotational arc to maintain the delivery efficiency  while the
additional intensity modulations based on static field treatment are inserted to chosen angles to
enhance the plan quality  this work presents how to select the regions that need additional intensity
modulations  based on adaptive learning cost functions given the beamlet intensity map 
   introduction
external beam radiation therapy is the most widely used for treating the tumor patients in these days 
before the actual treatment  how to deliver the dose is planned and optimized  which is called
 treatment planning   the ultimate objective of the treatment planning is to optimize the beam shapes
 fluence map structures   such that it maximizes the dose to the target  while sparing the dose of
radiation to the critical organs

the dose can be delivered to the target volume in two different ways as illustrated in figure    stepand shoot and rotational arc delivery  step and shoot  static field  treatment  delivers the dose in
discrete manner at the specific gantry angles  which is used for the intensity modulated radiation
therapy  imrt   on the other hand  rotational arc treatment continuously delivers the dose to the
target  which is applied to the volumetric modulated arc therapy  vmat   with a single arc in most
cases  static field treatment can provide sufficient intensity modulations at appropriate directions  so
that it can effectively preserve the critical organs  it  however  sacrifices the delivery efficiency due to
the feature of static field treatment  and      static beams do not own large beam angular frequency to
cover the entire angles  vmat planning guarantees a great deal of delivery efficiency with simple
fluence map structures and their transitions for continuous dose delivery with a single arc  the strict
constraint of having a single aperture at each control point  however  does not possess sufficient
intensity modulations for some gantry angle directions 
therefore  to overcome the pitfalls of two therapeutic modalities  we can come up with combining
imrt with vmat planning  which was newly defined as fusion arc dose delivery   the new
treatment scheme basically delivers the dose in continuous fashion  while it can stop and insert
additional intensity modulations at selected gantry angles to improve the plan quality at small costs of
delivery efficiency  this work presents how to adaptively choose the gantry angles based on the cost
function with given information of the resultant fluence map

    fluence map optimization for single aperture rotational arc treatment
the basic structure for treatment in this work is the rotational arc treatment with a single aperture  to
achieve single arc treatment  two factors should be considered  first  the fluence map should be
simplified to select one aperture at each control point  if the resultant fluence map is complicated  it is
difficult to take one aperture and maintain the optimized plan quality  second  the fluence map
transition between two adjacent control points should be sufficiently small such that the dose is
continuously delivered with arc treatment  in fact  there is a specific constraint to be met in the
transition of the fluence map structures for continuous arc delivery  eq     shows the basic model for
the fluence map optimization to reflect two factors

the field order   n   u  v  f     ai   mi n   mi represents the number of voxels  is the dose matrix 

d i is the dose distribution  i is the importance factor of structure i   and the residue imposed on
each structure i is denoted by  i   the total variation  tv  minimization in the first term of the
objective is to simplify the fluence map variations for taking a single segment  while the second term
in eq     increases the fluence map similarity between two neighboring nodes  the coefficient c f
controls the fluence map similarity to the total variation of the fluence map  in this work  it is set to be     to
both preserve the plan quality and maintain the delivery efficiency 

we basically used equi spaced    control points for the plan optimization with   degree angular
distant  the resultant fluence map acquired by eq     can still have a couple of different intensities  in
most control points  only one aperture is taken  while it is assumed that two apertures are taken in
certain directions that need additional intensity modulations  the next subsequent section will specify
how to choose the directions  where additional static field treatment is beneficial for improving the
plan quality 
    fluence map optimization for single aperture rotational arc treatment
in order to acquire the actual fluence map  the solution acquired by eq     should pass through
additional process  called  leaf sequencing   the resultant fluence map is classified into different
intensity levels  finally being split into different apertures  in most gantry angles  it takes only one
aperture for single arc dose delivery  while this work suggests having additional segment in certain
directions 
the directions that need additional segment can be obtained from the adaptive learning approach
with the solution acquired by eq      with that approach  it is important to see which directions are
contributing to improving the plan quality  this can be measured by summation of the data fidelity
n
terms in eq       i       i   ai x  d i         if the residue decreases  the plan quality is considered to be
enhanced  more specifically  we measure the cost function defined in eq

where xnew k is the fluence map having an extra segment at k th static field  and c  xnew k   is a cost
function with the fluence map  for instance  xnew   represents that the extra segment is only added to
the first static field  while the remaining static fields have a single aperture  this is well described in
figure    where it has two cost function values when adding an extra segment to the first and the
second static field  if the certain directions have lower costs  then it would be interpreted that the
directions can get profits by adding the additional segment  it selects the   static fields that correspond
to the   lowest cost function values  the reason that it chooses the   locations is to balance between

fithe plan quality and the delivery efficiency  for those   locations  the extra segment is inserted 
whereas the remaining fields continues to have a single segment

    evaluations
to validate the proposed algorithm  the prostate data was applied with the beamlet size   x     mm
beamlet resolution   the ct images obtained for the treatment is down sampled twice for plan
optimization  the planning target volume  ptv  is located at the center of body  corresponding to the
location of prostate  while the critical organs to be preserved are set to be bladder  rectum  and
femoral heads close to the target volume  at the initial step  the fluence map is optimized with   
static fields by eq      the single segment is taken in most static field locations  while the   locations
chosen from the adaptive beam angle selection method have two segments assigned  the remaining
control points are filled with linear interpolations on two adjacent fluence map structures  such that
the entire control points are deployed with   degree angular distant  the fluence map optimization
based on the tv minimization is performed by a large scale l  solver  called tfocs   this study
compares the two separate plans  proposed fusion arc treatment plan and conventional vmat plan 
the plan quality of two plans is assessed by various criteria  the dose volume histogram  dvh 
curves  which accumulate the dose volume matching the amount of dose of radiation  and dose
distributions are used to see the dose sparing to the critical organs  to evaluate the dose conformity to
the target  the conformation number  cn   is used as defined in eq

where v is the volume of ptv  v  ref represents the target volume receiving the dose greater than
or equal to the reference dose  and vref is the total volume receiving the dose greater than or equal to
the reference dose  the first term is required to be equal to or greater than             while the
second term is recommended to be large enough to assure the secure and safe dose delivery to the
target  the delivery efficiency is quantified by the estimated dose delivery time with reference to two
pulications

figure   cost function values at which extra segment is sequentially added to    static fields

fifigure   shows the cost function values of    static fields when the extra segment is sequentially
added to a static field  as stated    static field locations corresponding to the   lowest cost function
values have two segments  which are                     and   th static fields  the remaining static
fields have a single segment assigned  and single arc based planning is executed by linear
interpolation 
figure    a  and  b  reveals the dose volume histogram and dose distributions  which implies the
dose sparing to the critical structures in two plans acquired by our proposed fusion arc and
conventional vmat schemes  the proposed treatment scheme has slightly better dose sparing in
femoral heads and rectum structures than that of conventional vmat plan  the improvement is
explicitly illustrated in the dose distributions  where the dose sparing to the femoral heads enhances
through the addition of apertures to appropriate directions according to the adaptive learning cost
function values

plan  b     and conventional vmat  b     iso dose lines are corresponding to        and      of the
prescribed dose

the additional segments newly assigned to   static fields also affect the dose conformity to the
target  the proposed plan yields greater conformation number  cn  than the conventional vmat plan 
as specified in table    cn acquired by single arc vmat planning is about       while our proposed
plan produces about       it demonstrates that our proposed fusion arc planning strategy can
contribute to improving the plan quality in terms of the dose sparing to the critical organs and dose
conformity to the target  the enhancement in dose the plan quality  however  should accompany the
sacrifice in the delivery efficiency  relative to single arc vmat plan  which is listed in table    the
expense in the delivery efficiency is not significant compared with the plan done by the step andshoot dose delivery only  which is about     min

   conclusion
this work presents fusion arc treatment planning strategy  it inserts additional segments to a certain
static fields  where single arc based treatment planning is basically applied  the angles that need the
additional segments assigned are determined by the adaptive learning cost function values  based on
the resultant fluence map  the proposed planning scheme overcomes the drawbacks of the
conventional single arc vmat planning  and improves the plan quality in terms of the dose sparing to
the critical organs and dose conformity to the target
