abstract

growing prevalence of smartphone makes photography
easier than ever  however  the quality of photos varies
widely  because judging the aesthetic of photos is based on
several  rule of thumb   it remains difficult for computers
to rate photos without manual intervention 
in this work  we utilize aesthetic features of photos and
machine learning techniques to automatically distinguish
good photos from bad ones  our system is able to achieve
   fold cross validation rate of         we believe this
technique forms the basis of various novel applications 
including real time view finding suggestion  automatic
photo quality enhancement  and massive photo rating 
introduction

rating image aesthetic  as observed in          is a very
challenging problem  the difficulties are manifold  first 
determining image quality remains very subjective 
abundant experience is necessary for being a professional
photographer  and there is no effective way to digitalize
those rules of thumb  second  the same photo  if viewed by
different people with different aesthetic accomplishment 
might receive contradicting scores  there lacks consistent
principles to classify photos based on their quality  to solve
this problem  we need a universal representation of those
photography rules  and teach computers to discern good
photos from bad ones 
automatic rating is important because it forms the ground
stone of various novel applications useful in multiple stages
of digital imaging  applications spanning from creation 
post processing  and social sharing  are all based on this
technique  for example  intelligent camera could have realtime suggestions built into the view finder  letting the user
know where to point and shoot  it would be far greater than
simply showing a   by   grid without any active suggestion 
as shown in figure    also  post processing software can
automatically determine the best way to enhance photos
without any manual intervention  furthermore  if equipped
with this technology  social websites like facebook and
flickr would be able to recommend great photos more
frequently than photos with poor quality  in short  we see a
high demand in automatic photo rating that has the
potential to make photography friendlier and more
intelligent 

figure    an example of passive suggestion  showing
a   by   grid on an iphone when user takes a photo 
in this work  we picked multiple aesthetic features and
modeled them as simple and intuitive features  these
features were trained using automatic classifiers such as
random forest  svm and bayes network  finally  a model is
generated to predict the aesthetics class of any photo 
figure   shows the framework of the overall system 
we collect a dataset of      images from dpchallenge  a
photograph contest website      where people submitted
photos to be rated by the public  one advantage of adopting
this photo database is that these photos have been
quantitatively scored from   to    by a large set of users 
we collect      top rated images with average rate
between     to     points as the high quality photos  and
    lowest rated images that are scored between     to    
points as low quality photos 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows  first  we
introduce aesthetic features used in the model  the training
methods are presented thereafter  finally  experimental
results are illustrated and discussed 
aesthetic features

to design features representing photo quality  we determine
the perceptual criteria that people used to judge photos  we
reference principles of photography and select several
important criteria used by professional photographers to
improve photo quality  in our system  we need saliency
map as a way to segment object and determine area of
interest  we adopt the saliency map proposed by      
which is fast and robust 

ficentroid of saliency and color

good photos have good composition  meaning that all
objects are balanced around center  that is  if there is an
object on the left side  then there should be another object
on the right side to balance it  preventing the photo from
tilting toward one side  therefore  we hypothesize that good
photos should have their saliency centroid in some certain
position  to obtain the centroid  we consider all pixels with
high saliency  and calculate the centroid regarding the
coordinate of those pixels  note that we use percentage to
denote the centroid  e g   x  y                which is more
general regardless of the images resolution 


where ri    xi  yi  is the coordinate of pixel i and si is the
saliency value of pixel i 
we also consider centroid of color value  a well known
phenomenon is that different color has different weight  e g 
red is often considered heavy  and yellow is often regarded
light  in this work  w
o 
     to assign
weight to each pixel based on its color  we then compute
the color centroid of all pixels 
figure    framework of our automatic photorating system 
background complexity

attractive photos usually contain simple background as a
way to highlight the object in the foreground  in an image 
rejoin with high saliency is considered as foreground and
the rest are considered as background  we use ratio of
edges in background to indicate the background complexity 
the intuition behind this feature is that complex
background is very likely to contain large amount of edges 
a set of background complexity features with   
dimensions is extracted per photo 



where ri    xi  yi  is the coordinate of pixel i and wi is the
weight of pixel i given by
 

 

 

 

where l and h are hsl space value of pixel i 
both saliency centroid and color centroid are used as
feature  see figure   for an example of color centroid  a set
of centroid features with   dimensions    for saliency
centroid and   for color centroid  is extracted per photo 

blurriness

a blurry photo is usually considered low quality  to model
this effect  we calculate the laplacian pyramid of the image
with three stacks  for each stack of the pyramid  the ratio of
pixels that are edge is used as a feature  this is because blur
photo tends to have wider edges  which are more likely to
be detected at higher stack of the pyramid 

where k            since we used three layers 
a set of blurriness features with   dimensions is extracted
per photo 

figure    an example showing color centroid of an
image  histogram on the side roughly illustrates the
distribution of pixel weight  the centroid of each
coordinate is shown on the image  where the
intersection is the final centroid 

ficontrast

human visual system is more sensitive to contrast than
color or luminance  figure   illustrates the effect of varying
contrast of an image  there are many ways to calculate the
contrast of an image  here  we use root mean square
contrast  the standard deviation of rgb value  to evaluate
the contrast of a photo 


 

  

photo but not the other  we model this feature by applying
four   d gaussian distributions as weighting function on
the grid such that the center of each gaussian is placed at
each intersection of the grid  therefore  pixels near the grid
are multiplied by higher weight  and pixels farther from the
grid are weighted less  we then use the weighted sum of
saliency values to represent this feature 
by varying the parameter of gaussian distribution and the
saliency threshold  we have a set of rule of thirds features
with    dimensions for each photo 

where m and n are the width and height of the image 
respectively  a set of contrast features with   dimensions
 rgb  is extracted per photo 

figure    demonstration of rule of thirds  photos are
regarded as better if objects are placed around the   by  
grid  especially on the intersections 
 a 

 b 

figure     a  the image with low contrast   b  the same
image with higher contrast  in general   b  is considered
better than  a  
color histogram

we hypothesize that the color distribution of an image
encodes some information of photo quality  for example 
pixels with warm color tend to dominate sunset photos  we
use color histogram of rgb  yuv  and hsv  to model this
effect  a set of color histogram features with    x 
dimensions is extracted from each photo 

symmetry

sometimes  symmetry implies a sense of beauty  in this
work  top down and left right symmetry are calculated by
convolving saliency value of pixels on the two halves  the
result of convolution is used as this feature  to tolerate
small amount of inexact symmetry  we compute the
convolution ten times  each time shifting one half a little bit
    of the width   at last  we pick the largest convolution
among all iterations to denote this feature 
  

   

 

where i  is the left  or upper  half of the image  and i  is the
other half that is shifted  a set of symmetry features with  
dimensions  top down and left right  is extracted per photo 

noise

noisy photos are often considered low quality  to calculate
the amount of noise  we perform non local means denoising
     to obtain the denoised photo  which is then subtracted
from the original photo to obtain the noise amount  rootmean square of the noise is used as feature 
 

 

where i and idenoised are the original image and the denoised
one  respectively  a set of noise features with   dimensions
is extracted per photo 

rule of thirds

rule of thirds is a popular aesthetic rule in photography 
consider dividing the image into   by   grids  it is
preferred that objects being placed near the intersection of
the grid  figure   demonstrates the comparison of two
photos where the subject is aligned with the grid in one

gray scale

noticing that a great amount of good photos are gray scale
image  we add this feature to distinguish whether the photo
is gray scale 
 
mean and variance of color

the mean and variance descriptors are utilized to describe
statistic properties of an image  we calculate mean and
variance as a pair of the nine layers extracted from rgb 
hsv  and yuv  color space of the image  a set of
blurriness features with      x   dimensions is extracted
per photo

training methods

we trained the feature data with   different learning
methods  svm  random forest and bayes network  we
selected the parameters of svm by performing a grid
search on the c and   for random forest  we constructed a
forest of     random trees in training phase  the bayes
network was constructed by k  algorithm 
the original data contains    sets of features with     dimension  we performed forward feature selection to
remove potentially ineffective dimensions  correlationbased feature subset selection method was utilized to reduce
the feature data to    dimension

random forest outperforms the other two methods both in

experimental results

to evaluate the effectiveness of each aesthetic feature  we
performed a single iteration of backward feature selection
process  that is  we remove one set of feature each time 
and then we train and calculate the    fold cross validation
rate using random forest consisted of     random trees 
figure   shows the accuracy with different combination of
aesthetic feature sets  rule of thirds plays an important rule

discussion

collecting bad photo into our dataset is one of the biggest
challenges we face  existing photo databases often contain
good photos  h
   h
obtain massive bad
quality photos online 
in this work  we design several aesthetic features based on
principles of photography  however  there exists ways to
extend the feature set  such as dividing images into patches
and local binary patterns  lbp   which is popular in many
classification problem of computer vision  moreover  some
experiments can be conducted with the aesthetic feature set
not only on general photographs  but also on different
topics  such as scenic photos or portrait photo with human
faces 
the proposed automatic photo rating system can be further
used in many applications  as illustrated in the first chapter 

fisome examples include automatically remove low quality
photo and real time recommendation of view finding
