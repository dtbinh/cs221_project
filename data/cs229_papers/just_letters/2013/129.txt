introduction
alzheimers disease  ad  is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that currently affects more than   million people in the
united states  it is the most common form of dementia whose symptoms include the degradation of personality  memory 
perception  and cognitive skills  patients with severe ad can no longer communicate  recognize their family  or perform
the simplest daily activities  due to population ageing  the number of ad patients in the us is expected to increase to   
million by       and ad related health care costs to      billion   most patients go through a transitional stage called
mild cognitive impairment  mci  before they lapse into ad  mci is characterized by a mild impairment in memory and
executive function that is not severe enough to interfere with daily life  but which can be noticed by the individual and
other people  currently  clinical diagnosis by a physician is the only way for a patient to be diagnosed with either mci or
ad  however  the decreasing cost of genome sequencing  neuroimaging  structural and functional mris   and testing for
molecular biomarkers in the plasma or the cerebral spinal fluid  csf  has made a wealth of biomedical data available
from each potential patient  our study applied machine learning to the previously collected structural mri data from the
alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative  n         to diagnose a patient into one of the three categories  normal 
mci  and ad  after applying feature selection to logistic regression models we were able to correctly classify patients
with        accuracy for the binomial model      if randomly assigned  and       for the multinomial model        if
randomly assigned   our results illustrate the potential for machine learning models to complement and possibly replace
the traditional model of clinical diagnosis made by doctors 
methods
data collection
a major source of public data for ad study is the
alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative  adni  
adni is a longitudinal  multi center study that collects
data from ad patients all over the united states  the
dataset  which comprises biomarkers from more than
     
subjects 
includes
personal
history 
clinical cognitive assessments  genome sequence 
magnetic resonance imaging  mri   and positron
emission tomography  pet  scans  we specifically
worked with the t  weighted structural mri scans
 http   adni loni ucla edu   of     healthy older controls 
    mild cognitive impairment patients  and     ad
patients  total of      subjects   all data was collected
according to the good clinical practice guidelines  the
declaration of helsinki  and u s     cfr part   
protection of human subjects  and part   
institutional review boards 

data processing
for each subject  we extracted the structural t  weighted
mri images acquired at inclusion of the study  to
correct for the differences in brain size and shape across
the subject population  we then spatially normalized the
brain images to the mni space by using fsl software
 http   fsl fmrib ox ac uk fsl fslwiki    more precisely 
we first used a linear co registration implemented in
fsls flirt to compute a good starting point for the
more accurate non linear registration implemented in
fsls fnirt  figure    
feature extraction
once all images had been spatially normalized  we used
a region of interest  roi  approach and computed the
average gray matter density  indirect measure of the
number of neurons volume  in each of the     distinct
brain regions as defined by the automatic anatomical
labeling atlas  aal   figure      these     values 
labeled roi   through roi      were our primary
features 

ficlinical diagnosis  normal  mci  or ad  given by a
physician 
machine learning algorithm
we constructed two models for our study  figure    
the goal of the binomial model was to distinguish
between normal and diseased  either mci or ad 
patients while that of the multinomial model was to
distinguish among all three disease categories  normal 
mci  and ad   we implemented logistic regression for
both models using scikit learn python machine learning
library   in the case of the multinomial model  we used
a one vs all scheme to train the data 
feature selection
we used forward search to find the subset of features
that performs best for each of our two models  with the
reduced set of features  we saw about     
improvement in each models performance  measured by
its accuracy 
calculating accuracy
to evaluate the performance of our models  we used a
   fold cross validation on the entire data set  all
accuracy percentiles noted in this paper refer to the
results of cross validation 
results

images from      subjects were spatially normalized into standard
space then filtered for voxels corresponding to gray matter 
bottom  the extraction of average gray matter in each of the    
brain regions defined by the aal  each color represents a distinct
region   the hippocampus and the precentral gyrus are shown as
examples 

additional features
we included four additional features to improve our
model     age  age is the biggest risk factor for ad
 however  there is no significant between group
difference in age in the adni cohorts     apoe allele
status  the e  allele of the apoe  apolipoprotein e 
gene is the most significant genetic risk factor for lateonset ad    sex  the risk of ad has been shown to be
modulated by gender    protocol  the phase of the
study was included as a feature to correct for the
differing patient population between the two phases of
adni  adni  vs  adni    thus  we arrived at a total
of               features for our      subjects  n       
m          the label for each subject was his or her

binomial model
after feature selection  we achieved        accuracy
for the binomial classification between normal and
diseased  either mci or ad  patients using logistic
regression  the feature set used in this model includes
roi     roi     roi     roi     apoe  
protocol  roi      roi    and roi   in the
descending order of the absolute value of feature weight 
multinomial model
after feature selection  we achieved       accuracy for
the multinomial classification among normal  mci and
ad patients using logistic regression  the feature set
used in this model includes protocol  apoe  
roi     roi     roi     roi     roi     roi    
roi     roi     roi     not listed in order   since the
multinomial model uses a one vs all scheme  it
computes three decision functions to classify each of our
classes versus the rest  feature weight rankings for the
three decision functions were as follows

svm
to compare the performance of logistic regression with
other algorithms  we also tried to fit our training data
using svm with regularization parameter  c       again 
we constructed two models  binomial and multinomial 
the multinomial classification was implemented via a
one vs one scheme  we tried both a  rd degree
polynomial kernel and a linear kernel to see whether
there was any difference in performance between the
two kernels  the results are shown in table   

polynomial kernel
linear kernel

multinomial
      
      

binomial
      
      

table    accuracy of svm models

the linear kernel performs slightly better than the
polynomial kernel  as expected  the polynomial kernel
was prone to over fitting  its test error was much greater
than the training error regardless of the size of the
training set   overall  we did not see a significant
difference in performance between svm and logistic
regression  showing us that we have maximized the
performances of our models 

using structural mri data  we were able to correctly
classify patients        for the binomial model      if
randomly assigned  and       for the multinomial
model        if randomly assigned   a two dimensional
visualization of both models using pca shows that the
top features are able to separate the groups  especially in
the multinomial model  figure     our work shows that
machine learning can be applied to neuroimaging data to
successfully mimic a doctors diagnosis  given that a
structural mri scan takes       minutes per patient  our
method presents a faster  more objective method of
diagnosis 
observation of feature weights reveals the presence of
features that are consistently significant across all
models  these features correspond to the following brain
regions as defined by the automatic anatomical
labeling atlas 
roi      right hippocampus
roi      inferior frontal gyrus
roi      precuneus cortex
roi      precuneus cortex
roi      left amygdala
not surprisingly  previous molecular and clinical studies
have shown many of these regions to be associated with
ad and other neurological diseases that cause cognitive
deficiency  the hippocampus serves as the seat for longterm memory and is the first region to degenerate in ad
patients  hippocampal atrophy has been associated with
ad since the beginning of molecular studies in humans
and mice   the inferior frontal gyrus has been associated
with ad  major depression  and deficits in attention
tasks   the precuneus cortex is heavily involved in
memory recall and its atrophy has been associated with

fiearly onset ad   the amygdala is involved in fearresponse and emotional memory and its atrophy has
been associated with ad as well   the identification of
these previously known regions with our models further
gives credence to the applicability of machine learning
in the field of medical diagnosis 

learning models may be able to outperform and replace
the traditional model of clinical diagnosis
