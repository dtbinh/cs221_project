introduction

infertility affects nearly   in   couples in the united states  many of whom turn to in vitro fertilization  ivf  to have
children  during in vitro fertilization  ivf   embryos are cultured for   days after fertilization and a clinician chooses
one to transfer back to the patient in hopes that a pregnancy will result  this is a difficult problem because many
embryos which appear morphologically normal at day   may not be viable and or may be chromosomally abnormal 
in the past few years time lapse imaging of embryos
has emerged as a technique to aid in viability prediction  in particular  three cell cycle parameters
describing the embryos cell division over time have
been found to be predictive of embryo survival to day
  in culture  green and yellow data points in figure
    wong        although these cell cycle parameters can predict viability to some extent  they are
only weakly predictive of aneuploidy  chromosomal
abnormality  in embryos  avoiding the transfer of
aneuploid embryos to patients is important because
aneuploid embryos may appear morphologically normal at day    but the majority are nonviable and
ultimately result in miscarriage  furthermore  while
it is possible to test chromosomal composition in the
clinic  the procedure is invasive and damaging to the
embryo

in previous work to predict embryo viability 

our data set contains time lapse videos of     human
embryos from days   to   post fertilization along with
their chromosomal composition  we thank maria rodriguez for her help in gathering this data  our goal is to use
non invasive measures  time lapse parameters and morphological assessments of the embryos  that can be extracted
from the video to identify feature combinations that are predictive of euploid  chromosomally normal  embryos by
day   

 

methods

to accomplish our goal  we first extracted various features of interest from the time lapse videos of the embryos 
we then used the classification methods of k nearest neighbors  knn   support vector machine  svm   and logistic regression and feature selection methods to compare the performance between the classification methods and
determine which is best suited for our problem 

   

features extracted

features were extracted from the videos manually  in total     features were used which included timing between
all cell divisions  cell fragmentation  abnormal divsions  duration of cavitation and compaction  and morphological
scores

classification techniques

we used three methods to classify our data  first  svm with a gaussian kernel and l  regularization was used  we
used forward feature selection on subsets of parameters as described in the next section to find the best combination
of features to use  next  weighted knn  using the inverse of the square of the euclidean distance  was evaluated  for
this method  all    features were used  and the number of nearest neighbors considered for classification was varied
between   and     finally  logistic regression using the best set of features found from forward feature selection with
svm was used to classify the data 
to evaluate the performance of each classification method  the area under the receiver operating characteristic  roc 
curve was calculated for the different models within each method  the value of the model with the largest area under
the roc curve was then used as the performance metric for that classification method 

   

feature selection

previously published work has found three cell cycle parameters that predict embryo viability   st cytokinesis duration  time between  st and  nd mitosis  and time between  nd and  rd mitosis  we performed forward feature
selection with   different groups of features  we first compared our methods to literature results by implementing
forward feature selection using only the previously mentioned three features  we then compared the performance of
this group with   groups of features extracted from our data  all    features  features before day   only  early in
development   and features after day   only  later in development   forward feature selection was performed within
each of these   groups using an svm classifier  in each iteration of forward feature selection  we used the following
method to determine the best feature to add to the feature set 
   we start with a feature set f and add a new feature i   f to create a new feature set fi   f   i  
   for j           n  
 a  randomly split the data set s into a training set  sj train   and a hold out cross validation set  sj cv   where
sj train contains     of the data in s 
 b  optimize the parameters of the svm  i e  the variance of the gaussian kernel and the regularization
constant  a k a  box constraint  for the slack variables on the funcional margin constraint  using sj train  
 c  use the optimized svm classifier on sj cv and calculate a roc curve based on the orthogonal displacement
from the decision boundary 
 
   calculate au ci avg  

n
  x
au cj   where au cj is the area under the j th roc curve 
n j  

we then add the feature with the greatest value of au ci avg   note that we used the average of the area under the
roc curves from multiple  n        hold out cross validations because the training was sensitive to the data that
was held out

we found that combinations of our features could predict chromosomally normal embryos better than the cell cycle

weighted knn worked best using the nearest   neighbors  figure       with k      the area under the roc is

logistic regression

logistic regression was very sensitive to redundant data and ill conditioning of our feature matrix  this method
was best able to predict chromosomally normal blastocysts when using the   best features from forward feature selection  average area under roc curve         and was best able to predict chromosomal composition
only using the best    features from forward feature selection  area under roc curve           figure

conclusion

comparing the results from the three classification methods tested  best combination of all features   we see that
svm performs slightly better than knn and lr

parameters from later in development  after day    achieved significantly better classification performance compared
to cell cycle parameters or other parameters from early in development  before day     the best parameters were
blastocyst timing  time to cavitation  compaction duration    of cells before compaction  and blastocyst morphology 
of the early parameters  only the second cell cycle parameter was useful  other combinations of early parameters
can achieve significantly better performance if transfer before day   is to be performed  and late parameters should
be used if day   transfer is to be performed
