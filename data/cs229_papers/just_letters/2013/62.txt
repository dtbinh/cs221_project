than both svr and arima  the results of this paper
indicate that svr has the potential to become a
useful tool for macroeconomic prediction and for
regression in other fields with scarce data and or low
sampling rates  compared to arima  svr exhibits
less erroneous variance during testing and is able to
correct itself more robustly when it veers too far from
true labels  forward search with svr also discovered
the predictive usefulness of different leis  on the
other hand  though neural networks perform poorly
with exceptionally small training sets  one should not
conclude that they are not useful in low samplingrate problems  simulations with larger training sets
could produce more fruitful results
