title     
distinguishing  pathogenic  vs   neutral  nucleotide  variants  in  cystic  fibrosis  and  the  cftr  
gene  
  
introduction     
a  major  goal  in  genetics  today  is  to  predict  and  catalog  whether  specific  single  nucleotide  
variants   snps   in  the  genome  are  pathogenic  or  harmless     this  is  useful  because  it  will  
allow  doctors  to  immediately  know  if  a  patient  is  likely  to  get  a  disease   just  by  looking  at  
the  patients  genome  sequence         
  
cystic  fibrosis   cf   is  one  disease  that  these  prediction  methods  are  particularly  important  
for   due  to  the  severity  of  the  phenotype  and  the  high  frequency  of  the  disease     about     in  
       europeans  are  diagnosed  with  cystic  fibrosis  and  about     in      are  carriers  for  the  
disease   ratjen     doring            the  disease  is  characterized  by  the  production  of  thick   
sticky  mucus  due  to  abnormal  sodium  and  chloride  transport  across  cells     it  is  known  that  
cystic  fibrosis  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  cftr   cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  
conductance  regulator   gene   which  regulates  this  sodium  and  chloride  transport     one  
particular  mutation  in  the  cftr  gene   delta      is  the  disease  cause  in  greater  than       of  
patients   bobadilla  et  al             however   it  is  known  that  other  mutations  in  this  gene  also  
cause  cystic  fibrosis       
  
a  variety  of  snp  classifiers  currently  exist   but  they  generally  have  precision  and  recall  
values  around          to  use  these  classifiers  in  a  clinical  environment   it  is  essential  that  these  
values  are  much  higher     current  classifiers  utilize  a  variety  of  methods  for  their  predictions   
and  the  goal  of  this  project  is  to  draw  on  their  different  strengths  to  develop  an  improved  
classifier  to  distinguish  between  pathogenic  and  neutral  alleles  in  the  cftr  gene   in  the  
future   i  hope  to  apply  this  method  to  other  genes  and  diseases       
  
methods  
  
data  set     preprocessing  
the  truth  data  set  used  for  this  project  is  the  results  of  a  nature  genetics  paper  by  sosnay  et  
al              in  this  paper   the  authors  analyzed  all  snps  in  the  cftr  gene  with  an  allele  
frequency  of  at  least         in             cystic  fibrosis  patients   the  authors  conducted  
extensive  clinical  and  functional  analyses  to  determine  whether  or  not  each  snp  was  cf  
causing     my  tests  are  based  on      missense  mutations       of  the  mutations  are  cf  causing  
and      are  neutral     missense  mutations  are  point  mutations  where  a  single  change  results  
in  a  different  amino  acid  in  a  protein     as  different  amino  acids  have  different  
characteristics   the  mutated  amino  acid  may  cause  the  whole  protein  to  be  nonfunctional     
my  goal  is  to  make  a  classifier  that  is  highly  accurate   but  relies  only  on  computational  
features   i e   does  not  require  data  from  clinical  or  functional  tests    
  
i  am  looking  at  various  non clinical  features   allele  frequency  in  cf  patients   allele  frequency  
in  the  general  european  population   polyphen     adzhubei  et  al           sift   ng  et  al   
        provean   choi  et  al           pon p    pon p           pose   masica  et  al          and  
panther   thomas  et  al             these  last  six  features  are  all  mutation  classifiers  

fithemselves   which  estimate  how  much  impact  a  mutation  will  have  on  protein  structure     it  
was  my  goal  to  draw  on  the  power  of  multiple  previous  classifiers   known  to  have  different  
strengths   to  create  an  overall  better  classifier   these  previous  classifiers  are  based  on  
various  characteristics     for  example   panther  estimates  the  evolutionary  conservation  of  
that  amino  acid  in  various  species     it  is  thought  that  genome  regions  that  are  more  
conserved  between  different  species  are  more  important  to  protein  function  than  those  that  
are  less  conserved     polyphen    estimates  the  effect  that  the  mutation  will  have  based  on  
protein  structure     it  considers  features  such  as  the  differences  in  polarity  and  molecular  
weight  of  the  two  amino  acids     the  european  allele  frequencies  come  from       sequenced  
european  chromosomes  available  through  my  thesis  lab  and  the  frequencies  of  the  
mutation  in  cf  patients  come  from  the  primary  cftr  database   www cftr  org      it  is  
thought  that  cf  causing  snps  may  be  at  a  lower  frequency  than  neutral  snps   as  natural  
selection  selects  against  the  negative  cf  causing  snps      note  that  it  is  possible  that  the  
european  allele  frequency  data  includes  cystic  fibrosis  patients   but  if  so   likely  at  the  level  
of  the  general  population    
  
as  there  are  a  very  limited  number  of  training  samples   leave out one  cross  validation  was  
utilized  for  the  test  error     there  was  also  missing  data  in          of  the  panther  results  
and         of  the  pose  results     these  missing  values  were  filled  in  with  the  median  of  the  
rest  of  the  values     
  
machine  learning  
  
testing  performance  of  individual  features  
first   i  measured  the  success  of  all  previous  classifiers  that  i  am  using  as  features   table         
interestingly   these  classifiers  perform  better  on  this  data  than  they  do  in  standard  genome  
data   adzhubei  et  al             they  usually  have  precision  and  recall  values  in  the  range  of  
              in  the  future   when  more  data  is  available   it  will  be  interesting  to  see  the  results     
since  these  classifiers  were  already  quite  good   it  was  a  bit  difficult  to  improve  upon  them   
  
initial  feature  selection     logistic  regression  
the  mann whitney  test  was  used  to  initially  determine  significant  features     i  used  this   as  
opposed  to  a  t test   because  the  features  were  generally  not  normally  distributed     i  found  
that  all  features   besides  allele  frequency  in  cf  patients   were  significantly  different  
between  the  neutral  and  pathogenic  mutations     i  then  normalized  the  data  of  the  remaining  
seven  features  to  a  mean  of     and  a  variance  of          
  
the  first  machine  learning  algorithm  tested  was  logistic  regression   as  implemented  in  rs  
glm  package   with  my  seven  normalized  features     i  utilized  an  roc  curve  to  determine  the  
threshold  value  of          this  resulted  in  no  training  error   but  a  loocv  error  of          table  
       it  also  outperforms  all  of  the  individual  feature  classifiers     however   this  result  does  
have  high  variance  and  is  over  fitting  the  data     
  
secondary  feature  selection     logistic  regression  
in  attempt  to  reduce  this  error   i  conducted  more  advance  feature  selection  methods     i  
utilized  both  forward  and  backward  search  to  find  the  subset  of  model  features  that  
minimizes  the  akaikes  information  criterion   aic   of  the  model    as  implemented  in  rs  
step  function    this  method  resulted  in  five  features   allele  frequency  in  european  
population   polyphen     panther   sift  and  pon p        
  

fii  reran  logistic  regression  with  these  five  features     interestingly   the  resulting  model  
performed  slightly  worse  and  had  slightly  higher  variance  than  the  initial  seven  feature  
model     i  also  noted  that  the  precision  was  lower  that  the  recall   indicating  that  logistic  
regression  incorrectly  classified  more  neutral  mutations  than  pathogenic  mutations     i  
hypothesized  this  may  be  because  most  of  the  training  examples  are  pathogenic  mutations       
  
weighted   regularized  logistic  regression  
to  investigate  this  problem  and  attempt  to  lower  the  variance   i  tried  out  l   and  l   
regularized  logistic  regression  with  weighting     the  samples  were  weighted  by  the  
proportion  of  type  in  the  data  set         for  pathogenic         for  neutral    the  cost  
parameter  was  determined  empirically  to  minimize  the  loocv  error       i  found  that  l   
regularization  resulted  in  a  lower  loocv  error  than  l   regularization     thus   the  best  
performing  settings  for  this  method  was  l   regularization  with  a  cost  of            this  method  
resulted  in  a  model  with  slightly  decreased  variance     however   this  decrease  is  due  to  a  
slightly  increased  training  error  and  an  equivalent  loocv  error     
  
other  classifiers  tested  
support  vector  machines   as  implemented  in  rs  liblinear  package   and  random  forests   as  
implemented  in  rs  randomforest  package   were  also  explored     for  support  vector  
machines   i  utilized  the  same  weighting  as  previously     the  cost  parameter  was  chosen  
empirically  to  minimize  the  loocv  error       l   and  l   regularization  were  also  examined  to  
minimize  loocv  error     the  svm  model  that  minimized  the  loocv  error  had  a  cost  of          
l   and  l   regularization  performed  equivalently  with  this  cost  value     unfortunately   the  
best  support  vector  machine  model  had  a  higher  training  and  loocv  error  than  the  initial  
logistic  regression     however   the  precision  and  recall  values  in  this  svm  model  are  equal  to  
each  other   indicating  that  the  model  is  not  incorrectly  classifying  one  class  more  than  the  
other   
  
the  last  classifier  tested  was  random  forests   i  hypothesize  that  this  was  a  promising  
algorithm  as  it  is  an  ensemble  method  and  is  it  immune  to  colinearity   as  most  of  my  
features  are  classifiers   they  are  correlated     unfortunately   random  forests  performed  
worse  that  the  other  algorithms     i  used  the  default  value  of       trees     i  also  weighted  the  
classes   similar  to  previous  algorithms     i  noticed  that   despite  the  weights   all  of  the  neutral  
mutations   in  the  loocv   were  misclassified     in  attempt  to  improve  upon  this   i  empirically  
tested  increasing  the  weight  of  the  neutral  class     despite  drastic  increases  in  the  neutral  
classs  weight   random  forests  continued  to  incorrectly  classify  all  of  the  neutral  mutations

future  
from  this  project   i  learned  that  complex  methods  are  not  necessarily  better  methods     no  
method  i  tried  outperformed  my  wilcoxin  rank sum  feature  selection  and  standard  logistic  
regression     with  these  simple  techniques   i  achieved  increased  accuracy  compared  to  the  
current  state of the art  mutation  classifiers     by  drawing  on  the  different  strengths  of  
current  classifiers  i  was  able  to  create  a  classifier  that  was  better  all  around   
  
one  major  caveat  to  these  results  is  the  small  number  of  training  examples     since  each  
mutation  has  to  be  validated  with  extensive  clinical  and  functional  assays   it  is  difficult  to  
get  large  numbers     there  are  a  few  other  cftr  mutation  databases  available   but  these  are  
not  extensively  validated     in  the  future   i  could  test  my  model  on  this  data   with  the  caveat  
that  some  of  the  truth  set  might  be  wrong    i  am  also  in  the  process  of  acquiring  data  for  
more  neutral  mutations   though  not  in  time  for  this  project     furthermore   it  would  be  
interesting  to  look  into  databases  of  other  mutations   as  current  classifiers  perform  better  
than  usual  on  this  dataset   it  may  be  useful  to  look  into  datasets  that  have  more  room  for  
improvement
