motivation
a reliable way of human identification is in
high demand in todays society  there has been a lot
of work done identifying humans by faces or
fingerprints  but this evidence is not always
available  for example  in serious crime  established
forms of human identification are purposely distorted 
hidden  or obscured  nevertheless  everyone must
walk so gait is usually evident  in a more domestic
setting  human gait recognition has many practical
applications  you may be able to find someone in a
crowd based on walking patterns observed on security
cameras or identify which user is moving in a video
game more easily  we aim to design a system of gait
recognition in which a profile may be build by
training a profile on one gait sample 

figure    the kinect representation of the human
body  data collection was performed using a kinect
program that creates csv files of the x y  and z
coordinates of each of the joints pictured above 
background and significance
established technology exists in which video
can be converted into a three dimensional joint

mapping      the specific technology that we chose to
use for this project is the x box kinect systems
sensor  which has the capability of extracting threedimensional skeletal joint positions  figure     but
does not attempt to recognize the user  in the current
field of automated gait recognition  phases of the gait
cycle must be extracted manually and  for this reason 
current gait recognition algorithms tend to identify
features based on continuous image frames 
furthermore  most established methods of gait
detection rely on measuring a subject at multiple
paces to build a profile  we aim to design a system of
gait recognition in which a profile may be created
autonomously using a state based model for feature
extraction and identified accurately invariant to speed
and sample size  number of cycles recorded  
it is worth noting that the kinect system  as well as
other gaming platforms  offer a user recognition
system based on a range of biometric data  including
facial features and body shape  our system is unique
in that it is designed to require only one sample of a
subject walking to build a profile  and is this is more
generalizable to situations in which the physical
condition  or even cooperation  of the observed
subject is uncertain  in addition  our approach to this
obstacle is novel in that we model the motion of the
joints as a markov decision process  mdp  in order
to learn distinct profile features before identifying the
observed subject based on proposed distributions of
the existing profiles using particle filtering  we
recognize that without time to explore optimal
features  more precise recording tools  and much
larger data set  our accuracy may not be optimal 
nevertheless  this project served as a valid proof of
concept  and offers profound novelty  in the
implementation of gait analysis using a state based
model and we are confident in its generalizability for
biometric recognition systems 
problem definition
input  three dimensional joint tracking data for an
unknown subject and three dimensional joint tracking
data of known subjects

fioutput  a match of the unknown subject to the most
likely known subject
assumption  the unknown subject is one of the known
subject
this task can be broken down into two parts 
   parsing the tracking data into different phases of
the gait cycle autonomously and creating subject
profiles
   matching the unknown subject to the most likely
profile

figure    the above figure shows the bodys
positioning at each phase in the gait cycle  we use the
new gate terms rather than the classic gate terms for
our state based model 

figure    the figure above shows the state based
model of the gait cycle  at each state the model can
either choose to classify a data point as a point in the
current state  action a  or classify the point as one in
the next state  action b  

   approach
identifying gait cycle phases and forming subject
profiles
challenge  every person is unique  with their
own range of movement and time distribution in
individual gait periods
baseline and previous approaches  current gait
recognition algorithms process continuous frames to
extract features  such as joint angles and vertex points 

gait phases are identified using peaks and troughs of
joint locations and the phases themselves are only
significant in that they serve as a marker for cycle
length  a critical variable for certain normalizations  
and even this was accomplished after manual
preprocessing  therefore the baseline we considered
when testing the accuracy of our gait phase
identification algorithm was our manual identification
of the time stamps for each phase 
advanced approach  in our approach  the gait
cycle is considered in the form of a state based cycle 
so rather than extract features linearly
to accurately identify individual gate periods  we
began with a generative learning algorithm in which
we defined binary features for each phase based on
known joint patterns     we initially began
segmenting the points using a support vector machine
model  but realized that the gait cycle is considered in
the form of a state based cycle  so we modeled our
algorithm as a markov decision process in which 
states  every phase of the gait cycle is a state and
starting state is initial contact
actions  at each time step  round   you may either
remain in your state or proceed to the next state in the
cycle
transition probabilities  based on the average amount
of time spent in each phase  updated at the end of each
cycle
rewards  the squared difference between features
scores of a time step in the states resulting from
staying in a phase or moving on
isend  terminal stance and terminal swing
at the end of each cycle  we performed a policy
iteration and updated accordingly
matching the unknown subject to the most likely
profile
challenge  a human itself does not walk consistently 
pace and rhythm are subject to change  formally  this
means we must predict an entire set based on a subset
of information  therefore our profile features must be
specific enough to accurately classify the subject  but
generalizable enough to recognize the subjects gait in
a range of conditions  speed variance  
baseline and previous approaches  the most current
techniques      typically proceed with a hybridization
of support vector machines and two  or threedimensional sillhouette projection 
advanced approach 
to accurately identify the subject  we first had to
extract features that would be adequately specific to
each profile  to do so  at each state  we recorded joint
angle progressions and normalized time  in addition to

firecording features such as hip rotation patterns at
every cycle  with these features extracted  we created
a kernelized support vector machine  which we
trained on the joint tracking data of known subjects
before performing empirical risk minimization on the
hypothesis class 
we then treated the unknown joint tracking data as a
markov network and used particle filtering to use
the profiles to predict the unknown subjects next state
transition  potentials  and proposed distributions  are
based on the kernels in our svm and the state based
model used on the training examples and proposals
are updated based on demonstrated variation in speed
 angles  normalized times  and ranges are
approximated are reweighted   the unknown subject
is assigned to the profile that is the most accurate
overall 

   results and analysis
evaluation metric    accuracy of phase classification
the above figure shows the accuracy of our algorithm
for accurately classifying phases of the training set 
the golden standard being manual identification of the
starting and ending frame of each phase  the training
set consists of six subjects walking for ten gait cycles 
    phases in total  boundary error is the total number
of frames the algorithms starting and ending frames
are off by for each frame  the figure indicates that the
algorithm is able to accurately predict phases within  
second     frames      of the time 

analysis 
as seen in evaluation metric one  our algorithm was
able to accurately predict phases within one second
 ten frames      of the time  upon evaluation of this
less than ideal metric  we found that the boundary
errors within the range of    to    frames were
primarily due to the snowball effect  that is  if the
previous frame was off by two and the current frames
boundary error is three  the observed boundary error

will be five  when re parameterizing our figure to
discount previous error in evaluation  our accuracy
improved to correctly predict phases within one
second     of the time  there were a few key feature
incorporations we explored that were key in achieving
this accuracy  the first features we added outside of
strict joint biometric data were rhythmic sensibilities 
that is  for consistency  the coordinates of the foot 
ankle  and knee should be as close as possible at the
end of each cycle  by incorporating this into our
reward function  we were able to improve accuracy by
    as well as the accuracy of the profile recognition 
after looking more closely  we believe this is due to
the fact that regulating cycle length reduced the range
of the distribution we used in particle filtering  in
addition  feature selection was also a huge factor  we
explored over fifty unique features before finding
which held the most significant weight consistently
across test subjects  the most significant are listed
below

features across all subjects

evaluation metric    accuracy of profile recognition

non specific speeds that ranged from very similar to
very divergent from the tempos in the training data 
when testing our algorithm against speed variance by
simply scaling our results  proportional to the time
length of the cycle   our results had a maximum
accuracy of      we were able to drastically improve
accuracy by modifying the feature vectors extracted in
the personal profile and proposed particle sampling 
that is  we added additional parameters that
recalculated expected angles  time spent in cycles  and
their weights  depending on how divergent the test
example was from the training example  one of the
biggest contributing factors to the accuracy of our test
examples were the time steps we predicted in particle
filtering  particle filtering requires proposal  reweighing and resampling  and as opposed to doing it
at every time step that was labor intensive  we used a
time step of   iterations  every  second   this
preserved accuracy and reduces the runtime by      
over the increased number of cycles  there was only
an observed    increase in profiling accuracy  to
      which was not very significant 
evaluation metric    efficiency of profiling with
svms vs  hmms

the figure above shows the accuracy of our algorithm
for classifying an example against the training set
using leave one out cross validation  loocv  blue  
in addition  in order to test how generalizable the
recognition algorithm is  we also tested it against
unseen joint tracking data  green  from each of the six
subjects  the figure indicates that our algorithm
performs optimally with at least ten gait cycles  but
still performs well above random with half of that
amount  test example results indicate that our
algorithm was fairly accurate in generalization 
analysis 
as mentioned above  our algorithm performed best
when trained on ten c
we performed our algorithm for these two sets when
training with ten  five  and two cycles  this means
that in    cycles  the algorithm was trained on
samples of ten continuous gait cycles per person  all
six   the consistent  seemingly linear decrease in
accuracy as the number of cycles decreases was due to
the fluctuation of feature values  increasing the
number of observed cycles helped in both weighting
and averaging values   and it should be expected that a
policy improve over iterations   in recording our test
examples  we asked the subjects to walk at varying

the figure above compares the runtime to the number
of training cycles of the svm and the hmm to
achieve      accuracy  runtime was calculated
using the deterministic profiling capabilities of python
modules profile and cprofile  when the number of
phases considered was increased slightly  using an
hmm proved to be significantly more efficient than
an svm to achieve the same threshold of accuracy 
furthering our claim that hmms provide a better
model for our problem 
analysis
from this data we can draw the conclusion that the
hmm is more efficient in terms of data storage and
accessing data  the model handles data more robustly
than the svm and is more computationally efficient in
its development  this can be attributed to the fact that
the state based model does not need information about
all of its previous states to make decisions 
future directions
while this model was able to achieve high accuracy
over our dataset  assumptions were made that may
lead to high generalization error across larger datasets 
one important assumption of the model was that the
subject to classify actually existed in the original
dataset  a more robust model would not assume that
the subject exists in the training set  and would create
a profile for each user before attempting to classify 
restructuring the model in this way would preserve
accuracy over our dataset and lower generalization
error 
additionally  more can be done to improve the
features used in this model  one approach would be to
attempt to eliminate noise in feature vectors by
eliminating irrelevant features to create a larger
margin  this can be done manually by performing a
qualitative analysis on the relevance of features and
ranking features this way  or by running loocv with
different combinations of features
