abstract

politicians  governors  and other major political figures
to help generalize our model for the future 
in this report we analyze the political speeches made
preprocessing was handled by scikits countvectorby members of the democratic and republican parties izer  english stop words were removed  and countvecin the united states  specifically  we attempt to learn torizers defaults were used for the rest of the preprowhich features best dierentiate speeches made by the cessing  which yields word count features only 
two parties  and investigate models to classify speeches
as either democrat or republican 

 

 

introduction

   

division among the political parties in the united
states has become an increasingly large problem  the
american populace continues to recover from the most
threatening economic recession in decades  environmental crises have plagued the nation regularly  the
government shutdown  and the treasury nearly defaulted on its debt  when members of one party bridge
the divide to provide support in times of trouble  they
are met with ostracization from their own party  and
unfortunately polls and polarization research show that
partisan divisions drive the debate amongst those who
are responsible for solutions      whats more  the
american populace does not appear to be any less divided     
this paper outlines a variety of supervised and unsupervised techniques employed in an eort to flesh out
these divisions under the assumption that the content
and rhetoric of political speeches can provide insight
into the sharp divides we see in american politics today 

 

methods and analysis
naive bayes

we implemented a naive bayes model with laplacian smoothing as a first step in analyzing our
data  we had a nearly balanced set of     speeches
to train on      speeches coming from republicans
and     coming from democrats  on this dataset 
naive bayes performed reasonably well  yielding a
leave one out cross validation error rate of roughly
       in addition  after training a model on the
whole dataset  we examined the learned parameters
to determine which words had the greatest dierence in conditional probabilities  we looked at the
   words for which we observed the maximum values of log p  word i republican  p  word i democrat   
as well as the    words which yielded the maximum values of log p  word i democrat  p  word i republican   
the former gave us a list of the    words which were
most indicative of republican speeches  while the latter gave us the    words most indicative of democratic
speeches  they were as follows 
democrat  internet  algeria  bosnia  gay  assad 
tunisia  negro  online  algerian  lgbt  barack 
conversation  newtown  womens  ghana  secondly 
cyber  digital  kosovo  rwanda

data collection and handling

our dataset consists of     speeches      republican  
    democrat  by american politicians delivered during or after the presidency of franklin roosevelt  political lines prior to the presidency of fdr become increasingly difficult to relate in a one to one fashion to
the political parties today  thus  we steered away from
adding speeches before that time period  all of the
data was collected by scraping online sources for text 
the data is heavily biased towards presidents  however we have also included speeches by congressional

republican  russias  iraqi  conservatives 
narcotics  abortion  iraqis  sdi  tea  heroin 
unborn  whittier  liberals  rehabilitation 
palin              duke  eisler  gorbachev 
inflationary
some of these words  like barack and sdi  strategic defense initiative  are not as generalizable as others in terms of their predictive power  for example  the
 

fi   

word barack is much more likely to appear in a speech
by a democrat  not necessarily because it is in inherently a more democrat like word  but because it is only
mentioned in obama speeches  and obama is a democrat   still  many other words  like internet or conservatives  match quite well with our intuition on what
words democrats and republicans use 

lda

in each of the machine learning algorithms above  we
used the entire word count matrix to classify documents  using optimized regularization to reduce the
number of feature variables  we decided to use linear
discriminant analysis to find the linear combination
of features which best explains the variance between
the two parties  with only one component  we obtain
    svm
a loocv error of        which is nearly identical to
support vector machines are among the best o the  our performance using the methods above  our trainshelf supervised learning algorithms available for bi  ing error was        a plot of the speeches is shown
nary classification  particularly for their efficacy when in figure    since only one component was used to
dealing with high dimensional data such as ours where separate the data  x axis   we added uniform noise to
the number of feature variables  distinct words  ex  the data  y axis  for easier visualization 
ceeds the number of samples  documents   in addition  svms oer plenty of opportunities for regularization  we can specify any valid kernel function and soft
margin penalty term  we used the scikit learn implementation of svms  as well as a built in grid search
method  to search through our set of specified regularization parameters and classify our speech documents 
we specified   dierent kernel functions 
 linear  k x  z    hx  zi
 polynomial    hx  zi   r d
 radial basis function  e

 x z  

 sigmoid  tanh  hx  zi   r 
our method performed   fold cross validation on our
data  using each of the above kernel functions with figure    lda plot of republicans  red  and
 
 
d      r      and
    features
       
and us  democrats  blue   the data are jittered in the vertical
ing penalty terms c                    the optimal direction with uniform noise for ease of visualization 
kernel returned from this search was the linear function k x  z    hx  zi  with an optimal penalty term of
c      the training error for these specific parameters     pca
was    with a cross validation error of       
to gain further insight into the data  we used principal component analysis to reduce the dimensional    logistic regression
ity of our data  which works by finding the set of k
we fit a regularized logistic regression model as well  mutually orthogonal features which best explain the
we tried both l  and l  regularization  with varying variation in the overall data  not taking party labels
degrees of strength  we observed the best performance into account   we made a pca plot of the data  with
at        loocv using l  regularization  with a reg  the x and y axes representing the first and second
ularization parameter of      when we decreased the components respectively  and with points representing
penalty  performance decreased  this was expected  speeches  each colored based on political party  we nosince our dataset consists of only     data points  but ticed that some speeches  namely cuomos democratic
has around       unique words of features  so without national convention keynote and carters      state
strong regularization  we overfit on our train set and of the union address  both stood out as clear outliers
thus see a worse test error  when we rank speeches in our dataset  so we decided to omit them  i e  the
by leaving one out  the most democratic speeches were majority of the variance in our data was explained by
given by the clintons and president obama  the most these two speeches   following this  we computed k
republican speeches were more spread across the re  principal components for each k                 and then
publican party and included nixon  ford  and reagan  ran logistic regression using the k features from pca
 

fi using l  regularization with a very minimal penalty  
the leave one out cross validation error was recorded
for each k  we noticed that the loocv decreased as k
increased  up until k       at which point our loocv
reached a minimum value of        this error is similar to the error we achieved with the other methods
described above  although here we reduced the number of features in our data considerably  one drawback of using pca is that the interpretation of what
the k components represent is somewhat challenging 
however the fact that we achieved similar performance
and accuracy as many of the other supervised learning
methods with far fewer features is exciting 

figure    pca plot of republicans  red  and
democrats  blue  onto the first two principal components  note  this is after having removed the cuomo
and carter speeches  which appeared to be obvious outliers  

in addition to making an overall pca plot  we also
produced individualized pca plots for each presidents
speeches  see figure     note how speeches such as
obamas tend to cluster near each other in the plot 
but away from most speeches from other presidents 
the majority of the outliers seem to be speeches made
by obama  clinton  or nixon  other presidents  such
as ford  have speeches that are well spread out from
each other  yet are still contained in the general mix of
presidential speeches  while others  like lbjs speeches 
show very little variation in the pca plot 

   

figure    pca plots with specific presidents highlighted  notice in particular the plots associated with
clinton  nixon  and obama  which together seem to
contain most of the outliers from the overall plot 

k means

in addition to using supervised learning algorithms for
classification  we also ran k means on our data in order
to determine whether there were any inherent clustering patterns among the speeches we analyzed  we ex 

pected to see divides based on political party  however
we were also interested to see which other trends might
be present in the data  with   clusters  the documents
separated as follows 
 

ficluster       obama    palin

between presidents  this helps to confirm our previous
hypothesis that the variance in our data was partially
explained by dierences in individual presidents 

cluster      clinton    obama

name
obama
truman
reagan
clinton
ford
nixon
lbj
bush
bush jr 
carter
jfk

cluster      nixon
cluster      clinton
cluster      jfk
cluster      jfk
cluster       speeches     republican     democrat
cluster        speeches      republican      democrat
interestingly  the first three clusters listed above consist
almost entirely of one president each  either obama 
clinton  or nixon  compare this with the pca plots
in figure     the next three clusters contain a single speech each  and the last two contain all of the
remaining speeches  the clusters also seemed to be
somewhat topically organized  the obama speeches
in cluster   pertain mostly to the economy  aordability  and employment  all of clintons speeches  and
obamas as well  in cluster   are state of the union
addresses  nixons speeches in cluster   are mostly
press conference or convention talks  and concern leadership  cluster   regards health care reform  cluster  
is about imperialism  and cluster   is about taxation 
clusters   and   contained no obvious patterns  other
than that a reasonable majority of the speeches in cluster   are republican speeches  many of which are state
of the union addresses  running k means with fewer
than   clusters didnt divide the data significantly  and
running k means with more than   clusters didnt seem
to add any more insights  other than stripping away individual speeches from one of the larger two clusters

further  the results with k   are in the table to the
above  obama and bush jr  appear to be among
the most distinctive of the presidents  as we correctly
predict     of obamas speeches and       of bush
jr s speeches  while only falsely identifying    and   
speeches as obama and bush which were not  while
other presidents such as truman  reagan  and ford 
had low error rates  they had much higher levels of
false positives 

 
   

results
unsupervised insights

through k means and pca visualization  we observed
that most of the speeches we analyzed are similar to
each other  this is confirmed by the large size of two of
the k means clusters and the large collection of points
near the origin of the pca plot  many speeches by
obama and clinton  and nixon to some extent  seem
to stand out from the rest  and from each other  in addition  we noticed that for our dataset there was greater
variability among democrat speeches than there was
among republican speeches 

k nearest neighbors

k means and the individual pca plots above suggest
that speeches from certain presidents seem to stand
out more than others  in order to further investigate
the extent to which the presidents diered from each
other  we decided to run k nearest neighbors  for each
speech  rather than trying to predict just the political
party of its speaker  we attempted to predict the president themselves who gave the speech  consequently 
we went from trying to classify our data into two groups
 republican and democrat  to    groups  one per president  since we had    groups  simple random guessing should have yielded roughly a     error rate  in
practice  we did much better than this scoring a    
error rate  suggesting that there are real distinctions

   

presidential rankings

in order to rank our presidents by political affiliation 
we  for each pair of  democrat  republican  presidents 
held out the training examples for those presidents  and
then obtained the probability of each president being
democrat  we used a presidents average probability
of being democrat to sort our rankings  we also calculated the proportion of times that we correctly identified the democrat as more of a democrat than the
republican  we called this the h h  head to head 
score 
 

fireferences

using this method  the ranking we obtained in order
of most to least democrat was the following     nixon 
   bush sr      truman     ford     carter     clinton 
   jfk     lbj     reagan      obama      bush jr 
looking at these rankings  one can clearly see that
this ordering is simply not accurate  our final h h
score was        indicating that we did little better
than chance  combining this with the pca plots  we
suspected that our high accuracies in supervised learning were not a result of political affiliation  rather 
it resulted from learning enough about an individuals
speech style to associate that back to political party 
in addition to the h h ranking detailed above  for
every speech  we trained a model on all of the data
except that speech  we then predicted the probability
that the held out speech belonged to a democrat  finally  for each president  we averaged the probabilities
of all of their speeches to rank them as republican or
democrat  with high numbers indicating that a president is more likely a democrat   with this method 
we obtained the following ranking  with probabilities
in parentheses      reagan            bush jr         
   nixon            ford            bush sr            
carter            lbj            jfk            clinton
            truman             obama       
despite achieving      accuracy with this ranking
in terms of correctly predicting the political parties of
the presidents  and even showing some insight into the
degree to which dierent presidents are republican or
democrat   the discussion above suggests that individual speech styles play a significant role in the prediction
process

conclusion

we obtained mixed results via our myriad methods 
we did find that if we do not train on a presidents
speech patterns at all  it is very difficult to predict the
party affiliation of that president  despite this fact  we
obtained respectable results when we did train with
data from each president  this tells us that the presidents speeches were not related so much by party
affiliation and biases as they were related by topics 
personal styles  contents  and eras of the presidencies
themselves  this is encouraging  as we expected to see
the party divides witnessed today embedded within the
speeches of our presidents  but this is not necessarily
the case  in fact  our results suggest that the president
of the united states of america says what the president needs to say  presidential rhetoric appears to be
defined more by the personality and role of a president
and the times that he serves in than the party that
nominates him to that position
