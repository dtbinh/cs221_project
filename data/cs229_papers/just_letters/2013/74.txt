introduction

understanding the behavior of a complex network of genes within an organism remains a challenging question in biology  higher organisms may have tens of thousands of genes interacting and self regulating in
complex ways  and sophisticated regulatory mechanisms are prevalent  for instance  to maintain homeostasis  trigger responses to environmental stimuli  or repair cellular damage  in such a complex setting 
elucidating underlying patterns is essential to our understanding of biological mechanisms and to developing
therapies to combat disease 
the behavior of genes is thought to be highly related to their expression levels  that is  the rna
and proteins created within a cell using genes as a blueprint  standard microarray technology can now
quantitatively measure the expression of more than        genes in a sample simultaneously  this abundance
of data provides a unique opportunity to apply analytical methods in machine learning to deduce underlying
genetic patterns 
a gene network may be better understood by separating the genes into clusters that have similar functions or are associated with a common underlying regulatory mechanism  e g  those that correspond to a
biochemical pathway  for example  clustering may provide insight into how genes give rise to complex traits
     a major challenge with learning gene clusters  however  is that any expression data obtaining from a
single specimen is subject to the individual genetic biases specific to that specimen  this represents a source
of noise in the sample  in addition  expression profiles of genes may manifest differently in different cell
types  this problem may be addressed by analyzing profiles from  a  genetically diverse specimens  and  b 
a variety of cell types 
this work explores  a  to what extent the functions of an individual gene can be learned from its
expression profile  and  b  what underlying patterns can be learned about the underlying network of genes
by analyzing all genes  specifically  we examine the mouse and analyze expression profiles in two different cell
types simultaneously  we implemented a recently developed clustering algorithm  the hierarchical dirichlet
process  hdp  model      that allows for clustering in multiple data sets  in addition  we evaluated the
support vector machine  more traditional clustering methods  and methods of dimensionality reduction 

 

data   feature selection

our training set consisted of gene expression data for        genes in    genetically diverse mice strains 
cellular levels of mrna  as measured by rna microarrays  were used as a proxy for the activity of regulatory
proteins      for each mice strain  the gene expression levels were recorded for two types of immune cells
  t  cells and monocytes  although the gene expression levels of an individual organism is unlikely to be
informative  when expression data from a genetically diverse group of individuals is simultaneously analyzed 
the subtle perturbations in gene expression levels can reveal underlying gene clusters     
we preprocessed the expression data for each gene in each cell type by normalizing it to have zero mean
and unit variance  to assess the biological relevance of the clustering results  we used gene function data
for        cellular functions obtained from the gene ontology  go  database      learned clusters were

learn functional patterns from expression data 

 

selection of learning methods

we applied three main classes of learning methods to this problem  we first trained a linear svm on the
data supervised by go data  we then applied principal component analysis  pca  and a sparse variant of
pca to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize its underlying structure  finally we applied k
means and two related algorithms  the dirichlet process  dp  mixture model and the hierarchical dirichlet
process  hdp  to cluster the data  in particular  the hdp is a novel multi tasking approach to clustering
using data from both cell types     

   

support vector machine

gene ontology indicated that while the average number of genes that perform a particular function is      
a small number of function classes involved      to      genes  by using the go data for each of these
widely prevalent functions as a set of binary labels indicating whether a gene was involved in that function 
we sought to use a supervised learning algorithm to predict if a gene would perform a particular function
based on its expression levels across the mice strains 
we identified the three classes of functions with the most number of genes involved  membrane 
nucleus  and protein binding   and trained a linear svm     on the gene expression data for each function 
we performed holdout       cross validation and obtained a classification accuracy of     for the t  cell
data and     for the monocyte data  for the membrane function class  similar results with classification
accuracies of about     were obtained for the other two functions 
to verify our results  we compared the svm classification accuracy against a simple model which effectively performed a coin toss for each gene and assigned it a positive label with probability p  where p is the
empirical probability from the go function data that a given gene performs that particular function  for
the membrane function class  the random model also obtained about     classification accuracy  which indicates the linear svm classifier is no better than a biased coin toss on this dataset  as supervised learning
might not be the best approach for this dataset  we focused on applying unsupervised dimensionalityreduction and clustering algorithms to elucidate the underlying structure of the gene expression data

principal component analysis

we performed pca on the gene expression data and projected the data onto the first two principal components  figure     for both cell types  the first pc had positive coefficients for all    variables  while
the second pc had positive coefficients for about half the variables  the t  cell and monocyte data had a
highly similar structure with the first principal component  pc  explaining       and       of the variance 
respectively  and the second pc explaining       and       of the variance  respectively  this may indicate
that most of the mice strains have a very similar gene expression profile with respect to the mean expression
levels across all mice strains  and that immune cell type does not affect gene expression levels significantly 

   

sparse principal component analysis

although the pca results reveal an underlying structure to the gene expression data  it is difficult to interpret
the results as each pc is a linear combination of all    variables and the loadings are mostly nonzero  sparse
principal component analysis  spca  seeks to reduce the number of explicitly used variables by limiting
the number of nonzero loadings for each pc      we performed spca on the same data set and varied the
number of nonzero loadings  figure     when projected onto the first two pcs  the structure of the data
remains qualitatively the same  with most of the variance explained by the first principal component  in
this case  dimensionality reduction alone is insufficient to enable us to interpret the structure of the gene
expression data  our next step was to apply different clustering algorithms to the data 

   

k means and dirichlet process  dp  clustering

as a heuristic for assessing clustering  we performed k means and dirichlet process  dp      clustering on t 
and monocyte data separately for a range of k  we then compared the cluster assignments of genes to the
clusters obtained with k means on the go data  in order to match the cluster sets obtained from cellular
data with those obtained from go data  we ran an exhaustive search match for all k  cluster permutations
for k    and a greedy match for k      we then calculated the total number of common elements between
cluster sets 
if the data sets are independent  the total number of common elements can be approximated as the sum
of n bernoulli random variables  each with probability
theorem  this number
 p     k   by the  central  limit

n
 
can be approximated as being drawn from n k      where    n k    k   to assess the quality of
clustering as function of the number of clusters k  we computed the sum of the number of elements common
to each cluster in expression data and the corresponding gold standard cluster in the gene ontology data 
for each k evaluated  we also calculated the number of standard deviations above the mean number of
common clusters expected for independent data  the analysis indicated that a cluster number of k    
resulted in the best fit clustering  figure    left   clustering above k      was difficult to evaluate because
of the large size of the gene ontology data set  over        binary functions for each gene  resulted in very
long run times  we also evaluated the normalized mutual information  nmi  as a metric for cluster similarity

the growth of nmi with cluster number is expected     

   

hierarchical dirichlet process clustering

the hierarchical dirichlet process  hdp  clustering algorithm  recently developed by kulis et al       allows for
shared clusters of data across multiple data sets  fig     
the elements of each data set are partitioned in local clusters  each of which is associated with a global cluster  each
global cluster consists of one or more local clusters  thus allowing for shared clustering  this method is uniquely suited
to our data set because it allowed us to simultaneously ana  figure    illustration of hdp clustering  from
lyze t  cells and monocytes 
    
clusters are optimized based on a local penalty parameter  g   and a global penalty parameter  l and minimizes the objective

and k is the total number of local clusters  we developed our own implementation of the hdp algorithm
in matlab  to select the cluster penalty parameters that approximately gave a cluster number k  we
used a farthest first heuristic      clusters were calculated for the first      genes in order to reduce the
computation time  we estimate that running the hdp algorithm for the full data set would take up to a
month   convergence took an average of    iterations  results are shown in figure   

 

conclusions and further direction

dimensionality reduction with pca and spca reveal an underlying structure in the gene expression data
that is highly non random  although the linear svm only performed as well as a random model in predicting
gene function from expression levels  the unsupervised clustering algorithms produced results that were nonrandom when assessed against the go data  however  the overall lack of strict correspondence between
individual gene function and mrna expression levels suggests that the underlying biology of regulatory
networks of mouse genes cannot be partitioned into strictly separate clusters  indeed  we hypothesize that
deeper underlying regulatory mechanisms are at play  as our current clustering algorithms are unable to
take into account that a single gene is likely to belong to multiple functional clusters  alternative methods
that allow for soft cluster assignments such as dictionary learning or a multivariate gaussian mixture model
may provide biologically more realistic models of gene behavior
