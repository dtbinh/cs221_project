get to work on the actual repairs  in that case  it
typically takes about six hours to put up a new
pole  however  during storm related outages 
restoration information may not be immediately
available  sometimes there is much damage that
the utilities need to assess through a combination
of remote monitoring and customer calls  even
with remote sensing and controlling system 
utilities heavily rely on customer calls in the event
of large blackout  resulting in time lag in their
restoration efforts 

twitters effectiveness on
blackout detection
during hurricane sandy

december         

during the storm and its aftermath  social media
has been critical in spreading important
information and mobilizing relief efforts  some
argue that twitter was more accessible and farreaching than any tv network  with over   
million tweets posted during the height of the
storm      in this study  we examined and
analyzed the abundant twitter data to help
minimize the damage by future catastrophic
blackout events 

   introduction
hurricane sandy developed from the caribbean
stroke near atlantic city  n j   with winds of   
mph about   p m  edt oct            when the
hurricane ripped through the northeast  thousands
of buildings and facilities were catastrophically
damaged  and beyond the structural damage 
sandy also left     million people without
electricity mostly in new york and new jersey    
it was simply the most recent time that the most
populated corridor in the united states
experienced massive power outages  many
victims of the power outages had to wait more
than two weeks to get it back  the restoration of
power outage took long time not only because the
extent of damage from hurricane sandy far
exceeded the destruction caused by previous
weather related events  but also because there was
significant time lag for utilities to gather power
outage information and to dispatch their limited
number of field crews 

   related work
the analysis of natural disaster using twitter data
has been done by burks et  al in the study titled
early warning of ground shaking intensity using
tweets for earthquakes and by sakaki et al  in
the study titled earthquake shakes twitter users
real time event detection by social sensors     
     these paper demonstrates results for giving
advanced warning to critical facilities of the
magnitude of ground motion intensity by knearest neighbors and a generalized linear model
on tweet behavior 

the duration of power outage restoration depends
on several factors such as the main cause of power
outage and the number of areas affected  because
each outage is a result of different circumstances 
some may take longer to identify and restore than
others  for example  if a pole near house or
business goes down  it is easy to identify what
caused the outage  and utilities can immediately
 

   objective
our goal in this paper is to improve the outage
detection process through the utilization of social
media data  this goal consists of two subobjectives  both of which involve machine
learning using twitter data     to develop an
algorithm for early detection of the blackout

reza zadeh provided the raw twitter data 

 

fisandy were selected  some of the filtered twitter
data are shown in table   below 

locations and    to pick the optimal locations for
the blackout response crews to set up their camps

   methodology
the second costliest
costliest hurricane in united states
history caused twitters
ers to send more than   
million tweets about the storm     
  after filtering
to collect the outage related
related data  we developed an
algorithm to identify tweets which correctly
indicate blackout in the tweet origin location  this
would significantly reduce time required to collect
blackout location information for power utilities 
then  we created clusters of valid outage tweets
so that utilities could use the cluster info to
dispatch their field crews effectively and
efficiently  the process map below  figure   
shows complete methodology steps

       obtaining true blackout data mapping it
to the filtered twitter data
data  first  we obtained a
colored map representing blackout regions during
the storm  figure     using arcgis software  we
plotted the filtered twitter data on nasa sport
map   then  we identified whether each tweet was
created in blackout region
region  figure   shows the
plotted twitter data withh outage labeling

     data preprocessing
       filtering twitter data   first  we obtained
the raw tweeter data containing all the tweets
created in the united states during the storm from
           to            we processed the data
containing hurricane sandy to obtain tweets
related to blackout of new jersey  each tweet line
contains time lag between a tweet and th
the landfall
of hurricane sandy  edt           oct          
    
and the latitude and longitude of a tweet  and the
content of a tweet  to restrict target area to new
jersey  tweets written at latitude    
   n to     
n  longitude       w to       w were chosen 
then  we matched keywords
rds indicating blackout
to each tweet line  blackout  power outage 
no electricity  and no light  also  to minimize
outliers  we excluded tweets written before the
landfall of hurricane  finally  from the data
filtering  overall       lines of target
targ tweets
related to blackout of new jersey by hurricane

     machine learning analysis
       naive bayes classifier using the
multinomial event model and the laplace
smoothing
to enhance the reliability of filtered blackout data 
we built a nave bayes classifier which
canvalidate the true power outage tweets  by
applying this machine learning  outliers such as
tweet lines mentioning news or not related to
blackout occurred by sandy were excluded  the
accuracy of the classification by the nave bayes
classifier was estimated by comparing with the
labeling by a blackout satellite map 
word xi denotes the identity of the i th word in a
tweeter line and y indicates
whether the tweeter line informs real blackout or
not

   analysis result
figure   depicts how accurately the nave bayes
classifier labels the true power outage tweets  as
can be seen  five training sets in different sizes
were used to train a model  and the error rate of
classification decreased to about     when we
employed the maximum size of a training set 
although the error rate is acceptable  it implies
that there are difficulties in thoroughly
distinguishing between the validate tweets and
outliers because the context of tweets cannot be
understood sorely by the frequency of words

       k  means clustering algorithm
for the efficient allocation of power resources to
manage blackouts induced by hurricane 
clustering the locations of blackouts based on
spatial extent is necessary  here the k mean
clustering algorithm was applied to clustering the
distributed blackout spots and finding optimal
locations of power resources as below

figure    error rate of classification of true blackout
tweets by the nave bayes classifier  used five different
size of training sets 

 

fi   conclusion and future works
the nave bayes classifier for identification of
blackout using twitter data seems to yield
relatively high error rate           regardless of
the size of training set  we believe that this high
error rates are due to various reasons  such as
small sample size  lack of feature word patterns 
etc  this could be improved if there were more
blackout relevant hashtags in twitter  in order to
identify true blackout tweets  also  there could
have been errors in labeling true blackout tweets
using nasa sport map  although the map is
relatively accurate  the error rate could have
improved if we used the actual blackout survey
data from fema  which was unavailable to public
unfortunately 
during blackout    optimized location of power
stations can be designated by k mean clustering
expeditiously based on      twitter data  though
we selected   locations in our studies  the number
of centroids can vary depending on the number of
available emergency response teams from utility
companies 

figure    allocation of power resources by k mean
clustering algorithm 

we conducted      iterations of the k mean
clustering algorithm for the convergence to  
clustering centroids as shown in figure    the
spatially optimized centroids described in table  
can be regarded as the efficient locations to supply
power to blackout spots clustered by centroids  if
there are a limited number of power resources and
limited locations to place them  the k mean
clustering algorithm can result in very feasible
clustering by adjusting the number of centroids
and selecting centroids in restricted coordinates 

the methodology we developed in this study can
also be applied to other types of disasters in
densely populated areas where social media is
heavily used  we hope that our study could
become a foundation for further related studies in
prediction of various types of mega disasters for
more rapid response to life threatening events
