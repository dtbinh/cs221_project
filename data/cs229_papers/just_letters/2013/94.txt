abstractthis project aims to investigate drug protein ade
causation relations to identify target proteins associated with
the reported ades  we aim to investigate new drug vs existing
drug target protein commonalities to predict likely new drug
  ade relationships based on existing known target proteinade relationships  this would help optimize clinical trials for
focused testing on these predicted ades for new drugs  and would
drastically increase likelihood of ade detection in the clinical
trial stage versus ade detection post drug release for treatment 
thus averting serious uncontrolled and often fatal adverse effects 
we approach this problem by using genomic network models
and as our results show  this gives a better performance than the
present state of art which uses logistic regression

i  i ntroduction
accurately identifying adverse drug events early is an
increasing concern in the medical industry  medical errors
have been the cause behind death and injury of over one
million patients in the us alone  ades contribute to about fifth
of that number  iom        even though there are a number of
surveillance techniques in practice that monitor ade  studies
indicate that the best review technique is chart monitoring    
which however  is time expensive  hence  several automated
learning techniques have been employed to tackle this issue 
the most impactful research in this field has been the work
by cami et  al      where pharmaco safety networks ppns 
have been employed  in ppns  known drug ade relationships
on specific drugs are used to predict likely unknown ades 
the crux of this predictive approach relies on leveraging
existing  contextual drug safety information  thereby having
the potential to identify certain ades very early  by training a
logistic regression model  predictions for several ades were
made which were not listed in      database  the findings
suggested that predictive network methods can be useful for
predicting unknown ades 
we investigated drug target ade causation relations to identify target proteins associated with the reported ades 
thereby  we investigated new drug vs existing drug target
protein commonalities to predict likely new drug   ade
relationships based on existing known target protein ade
relationships  similarity between drugs are often computed
using pharmacogenomic approach     which uses adverse drug
events vectors and computes a cosine correlation coefficient 
another popular approach is the chemogenomic approach    
which computes drug drug similarity by evaluating chemical
structural similarities between drugs  in our project we have

adopted a genomic approach to the problem where drug drug
similarity is computed by comparing the target proteins 
ii  p lan of a pproach
to formalize the problem  we represent each drug as
a   by n dimensional vector with binary entries  the ith
entry in this vector indicates whether the drug targets the
ith protein  with m such vectors corresponding to each of
the m drugs in our database  we can construct an m by n
dimensional matrix  given a particular ade  we construct a
mx  vector y such that the j th entry indicates whether the
j th drug has at least one mention of the ade in our adverse
reports database

the modeling as done in the above described method
incorporated the effect of target proteins that were known
for certain to be hit by drugs  however  drugs often have
unknown hidden targets that are not reported by clinical trials 
and often these targets majorly contribute to ades  after
analysis through the previous model  we decided to modify
the drug target matrix to include possible  hidden  targets
given our knowledge of the targets that are known for sure to
be hit 
we hypothesized that genomic sequence similarity of
two targets might be a useful indicator of how closely
related  w r t genomics  two targets are  hence  with the
prior knowledge that a drug hits a certain target  it might be
possible to predict the probability that the drug will also hit
another  hidden  target given the genomic similarity between
the two targets  to ascertain the genomic similarity between
two targets  we computed the smith waterman score  due
to smith and waterman      this score uses local alignment
to compute commonalities between two genomic sequences 
the average score that the scoring system would yield for a
random sequence is the output expectation score 
we obtained the smith waterman similarity coefficients
between all our target target pairs as calculated by yamanishi 
with these coefficients  we computed the likelihood for a drug

to target a hidden protein by updating the probability of being
present as the previously calculated probability multiplied by
the drug target similarity coefficient  this allowed us to modify
table   to include probability values for drug target interaction
for all drug target pairs  we proceeded with the prediction
algorithm with this new modified matrix  table

iii  data c ollection
two drug databases were consulted to gather the required
data  kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
lists drugs by their database entries d numbers  and lists
chemical and structural properties of the drugs along with
their commercial names tn  usp etc    aers now faers 
lists information on adverse drug events and medication
reports 
from the kegg database  drug target protein datasets for
known drugs were obtained alongwith their commercial
names  the drug target protein matrix is a set of  s
 representing whether a particular drug targets a specific
target protein  and  s  representing that a drug does not target
a protein  
the most recent dataset from the aers database was
collected and drug ade reports were registered the drugade database lists out the report numbers and ades
pertaining to these reports for the  th quarter of       we
obtained the database tying the reports to drugs  and tied

back all the drugs to the respective ades  we used this data
to create an output vector for each ade  with  s and  s
representing whether or not a particular drug caused a specific
ade respectively  then  in order to improve the performance
of the prediction we decided to modify the drug target matrix
to include hidden targets given our prior knowledge of the
targets that are sure to be hit  we have assumed that any
adverse event report for a drug claiming that a drug caused
an adverse event is true  and that the drug causes this adverse
event 
we mapped the drug v s target proteins matrix listed in
kegg with the aers drug event listing for drugs common
to both kegg and aers  and were thus able to map a list
of     drugs corresponding to      adverse events  listed
in aers  with the corresponding target non target data for
    target proteins for the     drugs  in order to achieve
the modified drug target interaction matrix  we obtained
the smith waterman similarity coefficients between all our
target target pairs as calculated by yamanishi  with these
coefficients in hand  we computed the likelihood for a drug
to target a hidden protein  this allowed us to modify the
previous drug target interaction matrix to include a probability
value for all the hidden drug target interactions  we proceeded
with the prediction algorithm with this new modified matrix 
we created a network mapping the drugs to their target
proteins thereby creating a m by n dimensional matrix that is
sparse  the network shown in figure   depicts the drug and
target protein interaction network  this is the conventional
approach followed in order to predict an event  we also
proceed with the modified drug target interaction matrix to
obtain better performance 

iv  t raining and t esting
given the nature of our problem definition  there are
multiple learning algorithms that can be employed  we
considered a single ade first and decided to train the data
initially using naive bayes and svm  the error in testing
for differents algorithms for the five ades for both the

percentages  there was a significant reduction in the average
error percentage 
drug ade interaction matrices are tabulated below

we proceeded on by using classifier such as neural
networks for the present data set  for five ade s we trained
a neural network with    hidden nodes  we ran the algorithm
on both the original and modified matrix and noted the error
percentages in table    as can be inferred from the error

we noted that calculating the hidden target protein matrix
helped improve accuracy of our predictions considerably 
this may be attributed to the property of promiscuous drugs
being prone to hitting similar targets  therefore  the drug is
susceptible to binding to an adverse event causing pocket due
to the similarity in target protein structure with a protein that
was originally intended as target 
v  c onclusion
we noted that just by considering drug target interactions
alone without additional variables  we were successful in predicting ade with an accuracy of up to     using neural networks  we found that drug ade prediction accuracy improved
considerably by calculating the protein target similarities to
calculate hidden target protein likelihood  the effect can be
attributed to the fact that ades are caused by drugs attacking
hidden target proteins in addition to intended targets based on
target target genomic structure similarity  errors in prediction
can be attributed to more complex drug drug interrelations 
wherein two or more drugs may interact to attack different target proteins  more intensive and complex algorithms may help
cater to drug drug inter effects to improve ade prediction 
we noted that the small size of our training dataset may be
an impediment in the accuracy of ade prediction  collection

fiadditionally  considerations around ethnicity  gender  medical history and economic background etc may be crucial
factors in improving predictability of ades  the dearth of
availability of data for such parameters may make the pursuit a challenging one  considering higher order drug drug
interactions may also help improve ade predictability  but is
a computational and time intensive task  also  it wont work
well in the case of immune mediated adverse events
