in   this   project    i   will   discuss   the   limitations   of   macroeconomic   studies   on   asset  
bubbles  from  a  machine  learning  perspective   while  theory  models  rely  exclusively  
on  ad  hoc  assumptions  of  investors  psychology  and  trading  behavior   quantitative  
results   from   lab   experiments   have   limited   predictive   power    i   will   highlight   the  
challenge   of   obtaining   externally   valid   quantitative   results    using   data   generated  
from  my  economic  experiments  conducted  on  amazon  mechanical  turk  platform   at  
the   end    i   will   outline   follow   up   research   for   my    nd   year   ph d    i   believe   machine  
learning  promises  a  quantitatively  accurate  description  of  investors  psychology  and  
trading  behavior   the  holy  grail  of  macroeconomic  studies     
  
introduction  
should   monetary   policy   target   asset   bubbles    the   conventional   wisdom   is   no    in  
the          seminal   paper   monetary  policy  and  asset  price  volatility    federal   reserve  
chairman  ben  bernanke  and  his  co author  mark  gertler  argued  that   as  long  as  asset  
bubbles  pose  no  threat  to  federal  reserves  dual  mandate  of  maximum  employment  
and  stable  consumer  prices   central  bankers  should  not  be  concerned     
  
do   asset   price   affect   the   real   economy    if   so    what   is   the   design   of   an   optimal  
monetary   policy   that   would   contain   its   damage    to   investigate   these   questions   
bernanke   relied   upon   reflections   of   historical   evidence    and   a   modified   standard  
dynamic  new  keysian  simulation  model   he  concluded  that  asset  price  stability  is  a  
byproduct   of   consumer   price   stability    this   became   the   famous   jackson   hole  
consensus   that   dominated   macroeconomic   profession   until   the   financial   crisis   of  
         
  
in   light   of   recent   events    it   is   tempting   to   walk   away   from   this   paper   and   never   look  
back    however    the   challenges   of   incorporating   asset   price   fluctuations   into  
monetary   policymaking   outlined   in   this   paper   remain    in   this   project    i   would  
investigate   the   nature   of   these   challenges   and   evaluate   recent   development   in  
economics   from   a   machine   learning   perspective       i   would   then   go   on   to   outline   how  
machine  learning  can  improve  economists  understanding  on  asset  bubble  dynamics   
and  inform  optimal  monetary  policy  design     
  
challenges  of  combating  asset  price  bubbles  using  monetary  policy  
detecting  a  bubble  in  real time    
what   is   an   asset   bubble    for   economists    a   bubble   is   defined   relative   to   the  
fundamental  value  of  an  asset   calculated  as  the  expected  net  present  value  of  this  

fiasset    if   the   market   price   of   an   asset   is   greater   than   its   fundamental   value    we   are   in  
a  boom   if  the  market  price  of  an  asset  is  less  than  its  fundamental  value   we  are  in  a  
crash    detecting   a   bubble   in   real   time   is   challenging    in   part   because   fundamental  
value  is  hard  to  pin  down   for  example   if  we  observed  a  young  company  growing  at  
a   meteoric   rate    should   we   extrapolate   this   growth   rate   into   the   future   when   we  
calculate  the  fundamental  value   if  so   how  long  can  this  growth  rate  be  sustained   
there   are   no   easy   answers   to   these   questions    and   different   investors   may   form  
different   judgments    moreover    when   we   are   calculating   fundamental   value   as   the  
infinite   sum   of   discounted   earnings    slight   changes   to   expected   growth   rate   would  
generate  drastically  different  fundamental  values     
  
bluntness   of   monetary   policy   and   the   industry   specific   nature   of   asset  
bubbles  
conventional   monetary   policy   promotes   macroeconomic   stability   by   adjusting  
interest   rates   in   response   to   inflation    unemployment   and   other   macroeconomic  
indicators   when  the  fed  increases  interest  rate   borrowing  become  more  expensive   
this   leads   to   lower   investment    relieving   upward   pressure   on   prices   and   wages   
hence    conventional   monetary   policy   is   suitable   for   economy wide   problem   
meanwhile    most   asset   bubbles   originate   in   specific   industries    e g    housing   
technology   savings  and  loans   etc       is  monetary  policy  the  appropriate  instrument  
to  target  asset  bubbles     
  
inability  to  observe  expectation  of  future  asset  prices  and  the  quantitative  
nature  of  monetary  policy    
when   introducing   asset   bubble   into   a   standard   dynamic   new   keysian   model    we  
need       additional   equations    the   first   equation   describes   how   investors   form  
expectation   of   future   asset   prices    the   second   equation   describes   how   investors  
trade   given  their  expectation  of  future  asset  prices   and  the  third  equation  describes  
how  fluctuation  in  asset  prices  will  feed  into  the  real  economy   and  without  a  good  
characterization  of  how  people  form  their  expectation   no  quantitative  models  will  
give  quantitatively  valid  results     
  
current  approaches  in  economics   theory  
most   macroeconomic   theory   model   assumes   an   ad   hoc   expectation   formation  
process   for  example   in  bernanke  and  gertlers        paper   they  model  investors  
expectations  as  follows   
  
a   bubble   exists   if   the   market   price   of   capital    s t    is   greater   than   its   fundamental  
value   q t    they   do   not   rationalize   why   market   participants   do   not   arbitrage   away  
this  difference   if  a  bubble  exists  at  date  t   it  persists  with  probability  p  and  grows  at  
an   exgoegnous   rate   of   g   with   probability   p    with   probability      p  the   bubble  
crashes   and  market  price  reverts  to  its  fundamental  price  and  stay  there  forever     
  
bernanke  and  gertler  justify  their  modeling  technique  with  the  following  quote   
  

fiby  treating  the  probability  that  the  bubble  bursts  as  exogenous   we  rule  
out   the   possibility   that   monetary   policy   can   surgically   prick   the   bubble   
although  it  is  certainly  possible  to  endogenize  this  probability   so  little  is  
known  about  the  effects  of  policy  actions  on  market  psychology  that  any  
modification  along  these  lines  would  necessarily  be  ad  hoc   
    
why  is  this  approach  problematic     
 
we  do  not  observe   p a    the  best  thing  we  can  do  is  to  simulate  a  
macro   model    using   different   pairs   of    p a     but   then   the  
quantitative   results   may   be   very   different    since   monetary   policy  
requires   highly   accurate   quantitative   results    this   kind   of  
simulation   exercise   will   only   be   useful   for   qualitative   thought  
experiment     
 
 p a    may   be   market   context   dependent    as   implied   by   the  
quotation     
 
we   can   certainly   try   to   elicit    p a    in   a   laboratory    but   theres   the  
question   of   external   validity    it   is   highly   unlikely   that   average  
undergrads   and   wall   street   research   analysts   would   have  
quantitatively  similar  results   
  
current  approaches  in  economics   experimental  evidence  
experimental   findings   on   asset   bubbles   cluster   around   the          nobel   economist  
vernon  smiths  two  famous   papers   bubbles   crashes  and  endogenous  expectations  in  
experimental   spot   asset   market             and   thar   she   blows    can   bubbles   be  
rekindled   with   experienced   subjects              the   typical   experimental   set   up  
involves   an   asset   that   generate   earnings   with   a   known   distribution    and   having  
subjects   trade   with   each   other    the   main  conclusion  is  that   given   a   specific   earnings  
distribution    more   experienced   subjects   are   less   likely   to   generate   a   bubble   
however    once   the   underlying   earnings   distribution   change    even   experienced  
subjects  can  generate  bubble     
  
experiment  set up  and  data  
for   reasons   that   are   irrelevant   to   this   discussion    i   replicated   smiths   experiment  
with  a  twist  on  amazon  mechanical  turks  platform   heres  my  experimental  set up  
and  the  data  i  elicited   
  
in  each  round   i  provide       subjects  with  past  information  of  a  stock   specifically   
they   will   see   the   stocks   past   price    earnings   per   share   rate   of   return    and   price  
earnings   ratio    to   keep   my   experiment   sharp    i   choose   a   time   series   where   the  
company  does  not  pay  dividend   once  a  subject  click  on  a  specific  financial  metric   
the   associated   graph   and   table   are   revealed    if   he she   clicks   on   another   financial  
metric   the  existing  graph  and  table  would  be  closed   and  the  associated  graph  and  
table   with   this   new   financial   metric   would   be   revealed    a   computer   program   is  
installed   so   that   i   can   monitor   subjects   clicking   sequence    unbeknown   to   them    in  
each   round    a   subject   is   prompted   for   his her   best   guess   for   the   stock   price   in   the  

fiupcoming   round    and   a   range   within   the   best   guess   will   occur    at   the   end   of   each  
period    subjects   learn   the   true   price    the   accuracy   of   their   guesses    and   the   latest  
earnings   announcement    the   forecasting   game   continues   for        periods    the   time  
series   i   choose   is   yahoos   quarterly   data   from   september          to   june           the  
first  five  periods  are  given  as  initial  information   
  
the  use  of       subjects  and      periods  would  make  any  computer  scientist  laugh   
but   this   is   already   a   drastic   improvement   upon   smiths       subjects   and        periods  
set up    which   is   the   current   standard   for   economic   experiments    i   capped   the  
number   of   subjects   at         due   to   my   limited   graduate   research   funding    and   the  
number   of   periods   at        because   any   experiment   longer   than   that   would   result   in  
non sensible  forecasts  due  to  boredom     
  
  
  
methodology  and  results  
i   use   logistic    linear   regression    with   variations    and   svm   to   study   how   peoples  
forecasts   change   in   response   to   latest   update   on   earnings    prices   and   market  
sentiments    the   results   are   highly   sensitive   to   different   feature   selection    a   problem  
that  plague  economic  experiment  work  but  is  rarely   if  ever  discussed   to  illustrate  
my   point    ive   included   my   regression   result   using   weighted   least   squares   with  
individual  fixed  effect  and  clustered  standard  errors   notice  how  the  signs  flip  from  
table     to  table     on  the  next  page     
  
i  then  use  reinforcement  learning  to  investigate  how  long  it  takes  for  people  to  learn  
a   fixed    unknown   distribution   of   an   asset   price   distribution    the   most   successful  
configuration  requires      iterations     
  
future  work  
the  empirical  part  of  this  project  shows  why  economists  should  not  rely  on  
laboratory  experiment  for  quantitative  description  of  investors  forecasting  
behavior   this  is  because  the  size  of  the  data  set  is  necessarily  limited  by  the  
number  of  participants  and  time  periods     unfortunately   this  represents  the  frontier  
of  quantitative  research  on  asset  price  bubbles  and  investors  forecasts     
  
a  reading  of  a        cs     project  suggests  echo  state  neural  network  being  a  
suitable  candidate  for  accurately  forecasting  high  frequency  cycles  in  foreign  
exchange  market   i  plan  to  learn  and  implement  this  approach  on  i b e s  data  set    
it  contains  comprehensive  global  information  on  individual  analysts  estimates  of  
earnings   and  on  a  more  limited  basis   revenue   cash  flow   ffo   and  long term  
growth   it  currently  covers  over          securities  for  more  than          companies  
in  more  than       countries   u s   data  dates  back  to         and  international  data  
back  to         i  am  cautiously  optimistic  about  this  project   due  to  its  large  data  size   
and  because  of  the  increasing  adoption  of  machine  learning  in  the  investment  and  
trading  profession
