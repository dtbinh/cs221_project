introduction
our project seeks to analyze word alignments between translated texts  the motivation
for this study was the inversion transduction grammar proposed by dekai wu      it
models the alignments between bilingual sentence pairs through the use of parse trees
that represent the alignments as rearrangements of phrases between the two
translations  ultimately  we hope to bring about a better understanding of word
rearrangements in translation  which could be used to improve automated translators 
background

dekai wu states that the differences in grammar between any two sentences can be
described by a set of operations on pairs of phrases  represented by nodes in a tree  he
describes a method of taking alignment data  represented by a string of numbers
indicating the position of the word in the translated sentence  e g              and
performing an operation that combines two adjacent phrases into a larger one by either
concatenating them or transposing their order in the sentence  his idea was to try to
recreate the word order in the original string  represented by            by repeatedly
performing these operations  the algorithm is initialized by treating each word in the
sentence as a separate node  these nodes form the leaves of the tree  in the example
alignment described above              the first two nodes would be combined in reverse
order to give r             where  a b  refers to the interval spanned by a and b  a
second reverse operation can be performed to produce r           followed by a
normal concatenation and a reverse one to obtain the original word order  the
aggregate node formed by combining two smaller nodes is made the parent of the latter
nodes  and the process of concatenation and transposition results in the generation of a

data
we analyzed data taken from the europarl corpus      which consists of the proceedings
of the european parliament and their translations into the various official european
languages  we utilized the language pairs german english  french english  and
spanish english  the word alignments of these translations were derived using
automated software provided by the naacl      workshop on statistical machine
translation  the software indexed the words in the original text and matched them with
the corresponding indices of the words in the translation

in general  we used        lines of each corpus as training data and drew       lines
from a different section to use as testing data 
determining direction of translation
we first built a classifier that  given raw word alignment data  determined the direction
of translation  the classifier read automatically generated word alignment data one line
at a time  where each line of the data corresponded to the word alignment for one
sentence  each line was read both forwards and backwards  so that we had data for both
english foreign and foreign english word alignments  we then put the forwards and
backwards data into three dimensional arrays  specifically  we stored frequency counts
for each word alignment  which we represented by index in the english sentence  index
in the foreign sentence  and the alignment length  since a word often maps to multiple
words in the second language   we used naive bayes to determine the probabilities of
any given word alignment resulting from each language pair and used the probabilities to
classify that word alignment  for the following results

naive bayes works under the assumption that features are independent of each other 
this assumption is not obviously justified in the case of word alignment  since
rearrangements of words in a sentence can have dependencies on other words  support
vector machines make no assumptions about independence and often get better results
than naive bayes algorithms  so we decided to test the performance of svms on our data
using the libsvm library     we used the possible word alignments as our features  so
that the feature vectors for each sentence had entries of   for unused word alignments
and   for used word alignments  we tested on c svc and nu svc paired with radial
basis function  sigmoid  and polynomial kernels  and found that both runtime and
accuracy rate were on overall worse than when we used naive bayes  for example  on
c svc with a radial basis function as the kernel  we obtained the following results

since different parts of speech will rearrange in distinct ways  we decided to improve our
classifier by incorporating an automated part of speech tagger provided by the stanford
natural language processing group           we were able to mark the part of speech of
each word alignment  we then used a four dimensional array to store frequency counts 
where the part of speech tag was used as an additional dimension  as can be seen below 
adding parts of speech significantly improved our classification accuracy

classifying language pairs
beyond classifying direction of translation  we decided to utilize the different languages
represented in the data to build a classifier that  given word alignment data  classified it
into one of two or three language pairs  since our data always involved the translation of
english into a foreign language  we trained our classifier to identify the foreign language 
the language set for a classifier is the set of potential foreign languages  we used the

fisame naive bayes algorithm that was used to classify direction of translation  including
part of speech tagging because of the increased accuracy it brings  we obtained the
following results

 note that for language sets of size two  random guessing would have expected accuracy      while
for language sets of size three  random guessing would have expected accuracy        thus  our
algorithm does significantly better than random guessing 

given different language pairs  one would expect that their parse trees would have
distinct characteristics  and that knowledge of these characteristics could be used to
improve translation  by incorporating inversion transduction grammar parse trees into
the classifier  we hoped to gain some understanding of the extent that parse trees differ
between languages 
we used the nodes of the parse trees generated for each sentence alignment  recording
whether they were normal or reverse and storing these counts for each tree  we
then implemented the classifier using a naive bayes algorithm

this gave significantly worse results than the classifier that did not rely on binary trees 
this was unexpected  since we hypothesized that as a more linguistically natural way to
express word rearrangements  binary trees would give better results  however  it
appears that the tree structures for each language do not differ much in the above
language pairs 
conclusion

fiwe focused on two distinct goals  classifying direction of translation  and classifying into
language pairs  we found that naive bayes provided similar results and but was far
more computationally efficient than svms  so we used naive bayes for the majority of
our project  using part of speech tagging  we were able to get good accuracy for both of
our classification objectives  but analysis of parse trees was surprisingly unhelpful 
further study
an area left to explore is the accuracy of our algorithm on non european language data 
we hypothesize that with greater structural differences between languages  accuracy
increases significantly  however  such a test would be accurate only if all the translations
were based off the same original text  in particular  when we attempted to incorporate a
separate arabic english parallel corpus     into our language set  we obtained extremely
skewed results  with virtually      accuracy on arabic  however  upon closer
examination  it was clear that this was at least partially due to structural differences
between the english texts chosen to be translated  thus we decided to discard the
results
