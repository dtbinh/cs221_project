abstract

online forums provide a medium
for discussing niche topics  forums
consist of threads  where each thread
consists of an original post followed
by response posts  a subset of original posts are questions related to
the forums topic  the responses to
these posts are often expert answers
due to the niche nature of the forum  however  not all responses will
be answers  users are free to write
anything in their response post  in
this project  we train a nave bayes
classifier and a linear support vector machine  svm  classifier to distinguish thread answers from nonanswers  our features are preprocessed whitespace delimited terms occurring in each response 
we obtained training and testing
data by implementing a web crawler
and a web parser targeted against
the online discussion forum slickdeals net forums      we crawled
t     threads whose original posts
were questions  there was an average of       responses for each post 
giving a total of n       responses
for classification  we manually assigned a labeling of   or   to each re 

sponse depending upon whether that
response attempted to answer the
original question 
we performed leave one out crossvalidation on the eight test questions 
the nave bayes classifier correctly
classified                 of the answers and     of the non answers
           the linear kernel svm
correctly classified       of the answers           and                
of the non answers 

 

background

a growing number of websites feature a
q a style format where questions and answers are crowdsourced  stackoverflow and
mathoverflow cater to a specific technical
audience while sites such as quora and yahoo  answers allow questions from any discipline  these sites share similar features
such as commenting and feedback systems 
the ability to up vote correct answers  and
user rankings based upon response quality 
a common problem for q a sites is the
generation of content  users must create an
account  post their question  and wait for
another user to respond  this dependency
 

fion original content generation restricts the
growth rate of q a sites  we identify an
alternative to original content generation by
considering online forums 
forums are structured environments
that facilitate discussion around shared interests such as technology  sports  pet ownership  cooking techniques  etc  there are
numerous forums for nearly every niche
topic  the topic of a forum describes its
user base  and the collective wisdom of a
forums community provides a rich set of
expert knowledge about that topic  these
attributes suggest that a forum may provide
a compelling dataset for a q a site 
consider the structure of a forum  forums consists of threads  where each thread
contains an original post followed by response posts  a subset of original posts will
be questions related to that forums topic 
for example  a forum for motorcycling enthusiasts may contain questions about motorcycle engines and parts  however  unlike
a q a site  responses to forum questions
are not required to answer that question 
forum users are free to respond to a question in any manner they see fit  the purpose
of this project is to classify each response to
a forum question based upon whether or not
that response answers the question  the set
of questions and their answers may then be
used to populate the database of a q a
site 

 

the majority of this pseudocode does not
require machine learning  the crawler grabs
the html for each thread  a deterministic
algorithm parses the posts from the html 
and an english natural language processing
program determines if the first post is a
question  the machine learning comes in
when we attempt to filter the responses
for those that answer the original question 
consider the following question from the
forum slickdeals net forums  
q  what is the best black friday
deal on a    led tv 

this user is looking for a black friday sale on a big screen tv  he has
asked a frugally minded community for
help  lets look at some of the responses 
r    im also looking for a good deal 
r    i am in the same market 
r         vizio at sams club is the best deal 
r    i havent seen any deals yet  guys 
r    walmart has led vizio    hz for      
r    sharp for       at microcenter 

the first  second and fourth users have
shared that they are also interested in such
a deal  their responses may provide the
original poster with a sense of camaraderie 
but they do not answer his question  the
third  fifth and sixth responses provide direct answers to the original question 
we crawled t     threads whose original
posts were questions about product sales 
similar to the question above  there was
an average of       responses for each thread 
giving a total of n       responses for classification  we manually assigned a labeling
of   or   to each response depending upon
whether or not that response answered the
original question  there were more nonanswers than answers  with a ratio of    
to     
we used our manually assigned labelings to train a nave bayes classifier and a
linear kernel svm classifier as follows 

methods

in order to obtain a large dataset  we initially built a web crawler and a web parser
targeted against the online discussion forum
slickdeals net forums  pseudocode is given
below 
for each thread in forum 
originalpost   getfirstpost thread 
if originalpost  isquestion  
responses   getremainingposts thread 
answers   filter responses 

 

fifigure    classification accuracy versus number of training samples for the nave bayes and svm classifiers  separated out for answers and non answers 

let r            rn be the list of responses to
all questions  i e   r          each ri is tokenized into a set of white space delimited
strings  and each string undergoes a series
of preprocessing steps 

prediction is given by 
p rn          s 
p  s   rn          p  rn        
 
p  s 
 
 
m

   strip all non ascii characters
   map numeric prices  e g              
      etc  
to a single common term 
price term

   stem words  e g  prices  price  reviewing  review  lowered  lower 
etc  

the implementation is similar to that given
in the lecture notes      laplace smoothing was applied to account for terms that
may appear in rn      but not in the training
set  we implemented the nave bayes classifier in matlab following the formula above 
the linear svm classifier was implemented in
c c   by fan  et  al       the frequency
count vectors for each term along with their
manual classification were provided as features
to the linear svm 

   add the concatenation of adjacent terms
to the terms list  e g  no deal forms three
terms  no  deal  and nodeal 
the frequencies of each term in the nonanswer set of responses and the answer set of
responses are used to train the classifiers  for
a new response  rn      consisting of preprocessed strings s   s            sm   the nave bayes

results

a non answer classification  these terms
included deal  price term  and  interestingly  at  the latter of these may
have contributed to the      boost that
was found when common words were left in
the algorithm 

we initially removed common words from
the feature set  but found that the classifiers accuracies improved when they were
left in       improvement   concatenating
adjacent words also led to a      improvement  as described in the methods section 
this may be accounted for by the observation that many english words are negated
by the word immediately before them  e g 
no deal   we performed leave one out
cross validation on the   questions  the
overall accuracy demonstrated with the    
responses was              correctly classified responses  for the nave bayes classifier  and              correctly classified
responses  for the linear svm  the nave
bayes classifier correctly classified      
          of the answers and     of the
non answers            the linear kernel
svm correctly classified       of the answers           and                 of the
non answers  the difference between the
answer and non answer classification accuracies was likely due to the large number of
non answer responses       relative to answers       
although the classifier accuracies were
not exceptional  the utility of the algorithm
was clearly visible by sorting the responses
by their classification probabilities  for the
example given in the methods section  the
algorithm produced the following sorting 

 

conclusion

online forums provide a valuable resource
for asking questions about niche topics  our
project demonstrates a preliminary method
for organizing responses to forum questions
based upon whether the response answers
the original question  since we restricted
our consideration to questions pertaining to
product deals  a natural extension of this
project is to apply the algorithm to arbitrary questions  this will require taking
into consideration the content of the question itself  a problem in the domain of natural language processing  we speculate that
this will require a separate clustering algorithm in order to group questions by related
semantics  responses to clustered questions  such as all questions beginning with
when or where  could be used to train
a classifier as in this paper
