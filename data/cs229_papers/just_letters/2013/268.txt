abstract
several recent research initiatives in the field of development economics have studied and provided
substantial insight into the mechanics of information diffusal in small village social networks  in particular
those without formal mass communication infrastructure in place  i e   email  television   this research
aims to further explore the dynamics of communication in these networks  focusing on the possibility
that village households share and withold information strategically  only sharing with neighbors exhibiting
certain characteristics  in an individually rational manner  a model of probabilistic information diffusion
is developed  the parameters of which are estimated via the generalized method of moments  gmm 
and tested with empirical data 

 

background  information diffusion in village networks

banerjee  et al         studied the way in which the spread of information about microfinance programs is
affected by whom in the community the information is given to initially  the information injection point  
finding that giving the information to more central figures in the community significantly increases the
diffusal of the information throughout the village      conley and udry        studied the adoption of new
agricultural technology in ghana from a social network standpoint  and concluded that information has
value in these villages  as do the network connections through which that information flows      most
recently  breza and chandrasekhar        explored the possibility that microloan recipients in rural villages
of karnataka  india can be influenced to save and invest these loans more efficiently if they are paired with
a peer monitor who is influential in the village  and indeed found that randomly assigned central monitors
generate considerably larger increases in savings attainment     

 

generalized method of moments estimation

before presenting the model  we describe the generalized method of moments  gmm  estimation framework 
as this is the crucial statistical  and cs    related  tool used in this work  gmm is a generalization of
maximum likelihood estimation  which is used primarily in econometrics to learn optimal model parameter
estimates when the probability distribution of the data is not fully specified or completely unknown and thus
mle is not feasible  we will see  however  that if this distribution is specified we can recover the maximum
likelihood estimator from within the gmm framework 
the efficacy of a particular gmm estimation depends upon the specification of informative moment
conditions  characteristics of the data which will be used to match up the data generated by the model

 

fiwith empirical data  specifically  the euclidean distance between the sample  empirical  moments and the
theoretical  model generated  moments will be minimized to obtain the optimal model parameters 
as an example  consider the case of standard linear regression  in which we try to estimate the unknown
parameters  which generate the observed parameters y as a function of observed data x with stochastic
noise u  y   t x   u  the standard linear regression model asserts that  conditioned on the observations
x  the noise terms have mean zero  i e that e u x       this condition  along with the regression equation 
leads to the fact that e xu    e x y  t x        which we use as our moment condition  thus we would
like to find an estimate b of the true value of   such that     holds for some n samples   x i    y  i    n
i   weve
obtained  we dont have access to the true data  otherwise we could just solve for  directly   to achieve
this  the gmm trick is to rewrite     in terms of our sample data  by replacing all of the expected values
with sample means 
n
n
  x  i   i  bt  i 
  x  i   i 
x u  
x  y   x       
n i  
n i  

now we simply solve for the optimal parameter estimate b and obtain 
b  

n
x

  
x i   x i   t

i  

n
x

x i  y  i     x t x   x t y 

i  

which we recognize as our standard ols estimator 
the power of gmm is further revealed by noticing that the maximum likelihood estimator can be obtained by noting that the true  which maximizes the datas likelihood satisfies the condition e        x    
   thus via the gmm trick we again rewrite this condition in terms of a given sample of size n as
n
i
  xh
   b   xi       
n i  

which  when solved  results in precisely the maximum likelihood estimator  of the data 

 

the model

we now return to the model of strategic information  we have network data from    villages in rural
karnataka  india  in    villages  we had randomly invited individuals to come to participate in a game  we
had told about    people about this at random and then asked them to invite their friends  telling them
that there were only    slots but that these are cooperative games with others and therefore they may face
better payoffs if they bring friends  thus the core idea of the model is that there is a tension in the passing
of information  if you dont tell others  then you dont get to play with your friends  which generates higher
payoffs   but if you do tell others  they may tell others  which generates low returns for you  since there
is more rivalry   therefore  our model implements cutoff rules  namely  that you only tell neighbors that
themselves are not too popular  so they do not pass information too much  formally  we define the diffusion
model in terms of   parameters 
           the probability that you accidentally inform someone you did not intend to 
 q          the probability that you inform someone that you intended to 
           the cutoff parameter  and
 p          the probability that you act on a given piece of information 

 

fiwhere the cutoff parameter asserts that you inform all neighbors j  ni if p dj       where p   is the
percentile function from the networks global degree distribution 
the models dynamics are illustrated in the following figures  first  invites are given to randomly selected
household representatives  the nodes containing white dots   who then are faced with the strategic decision
of whether to invite their neighbors 

households then choose to share with neighbors whose degree is below a certain threshold determined by
tau  green edges indicate that information was shared  red edges indicate that information was not shared  

in addition to the diffusion model  however  we need to model the relationship between how informed a
given household is and the probability that someone in the household actually shows up for the game  so
that the empirical data can be compared with the simulated data via gmm  to incorporate this into the
overall model  we introduce the following notation 
let q   be a matrix of probabilities  defined as
 
q    if p dj    
qij  
 

if p dj     
then we can define another matrix mt such that
mt      

t
x
 q    a g  t  
t  

 

fiwhere a g  is just the incidence matrix of the graph representing the social network  the result of this
definition is that mt represents the expected number of times that information given to household i in the
network reaches household j after t timesteps  in our simulations  we set t       then if we let mi be the
ith row sum of mt we can model the probability p  yi      of someone from a household i showing up as
p  yi     mi            p mi  
thus  we have that we need to estimate the parameter vector       q    p  to fully specify our model 
in the next section  we outline the procedure used to estimate these parameters via gmm 

 

gmm objective optimization

as we are using gmm to estimate the parameters from the prior section  it is crucial that we develop a set
of   moments  thus fully specifying the system  so we can perform the matching up of population and
sample moments explained in the gmm section  the moments we developed are as follows 
   the share of invited households with high centrality that showed up
   the share of invited households with low centrality that showed up
   the share of non invited households with high centrality that showed up
   the shared of non invited households with low centrality that showed up
for each of these  centrality is defined to be the eigenvector centrality of the household with respect to the
villages adjacency matrix  matlab code  available upon request  was written to compute the empirical
values of these moments  as well as code to simulate the model and compute their simulated values  the
moments were plotted pairwise and no pairs were found to be strongly collinear 
once these moments are defined and computed  we let gsim r    represent the vector of sample moments
of the simulation data for household r and let gemp r represent the vector of sample moments of the empirical
data  and obtain the optimal parameter settings b via
b    arg min


  x
gsim r     gemp r
r r

 t

  x
gsim r     gemp r
r r

 
 

it should be stressed here that the ability to obtain the optimal parameters settings by solving this equation
represents the primary advantage of gmm over maximum likelihood estimation for our model  we cannot
observe a households  directly  and gmm allows us to estimate it without making any prior assumptions
about its distribution  as ml would require us to do in this case 

 

results

the primary computational challenge presented by the model is that the objective function given in the prior
section is not convex in its parameters  as can be seen by plotting it as a function of any of s elements with
the other three held constant  thus we implemented a simulated annealing procedure in matlab to search
for its minima and attempt to find globally optimal solutions  which resulted in the parameter settings
q                           p        
and in a gmm error  the value of the minimand  of         we then performed a heuristic bootstrap
procedure  following the method of      with b        village level bayesian bootstrap estimates and found
that the parameter of interest  is indeed statistically significant  with a standard error of      

 

fiwe also measured the temporal robustness of the model by re running the simulation with t     
representing the myopic case wherein only the invited households have a chance to share information  and
with t      representing the case where all households in each experimental village  with   exceptions 
would have had a chance to receive the information  in both cases  we find that the resulting  is within one
standard error of the t     case  indicating robustness to measurement over different time spans 

 

conclusions next steps

given the statistically significant  estimate  we have evidence that village households indeed engage
in strategic and individually rational decision making when sharing information with neighbors  this
is of particular interest to policymakers  as several financial instruments depend heavily on participants
strategic divulgence or withholding of information  for example  consider the standard microfinance model
in which loans are given out to groups of individuals  and if one of these individuals does not repay the
loan it is up to the remaining group members to make up the difference or default on the loan  it is
thus of crucial importance to an individual to choose group members whom they believe are trustworthy
and capable of repaying  inducing a strategic decision making process in which an individual must examine
the characteristics of their neighbors and decide whether to invite them to their loan group or not  our
model represents a special case of this process  wherein the utilized strategic filtering characteristic is the
percentile of the neighbors degree 
this observation indicates a natural next step for our research  which is to further study the dynamics
of information diffusal in the village networks using different characteristics as the basis for the strategic
choice  we have already begun this study  by constructing demographic vectors xr i representing demographic
information about the household i in village r such as reported income  caste  religious affiliation  roofing
material of their home  type of latrine  access to electricity  and so on  we are currently developing a
regression procedure to estimate the effect changes in any of these variables have on neighbors information
sharing choices  which will allow greater insight into the dynamics of information diffusal in village networks
