detection of a single hand shape in the foreground of still images
toan tran  dtoan stanford edu 

   introduction
this paper is about an image detection system that can detect the presence of human hands
organized in a heart shape in still images  for example  people very often create heart shapes
using their hand  such as the pictures in figure    the input to the detector is a still image  the
output of the detector consists of two pieces of data 
x a binary label indicating if there is a heart hand shape in the image  y      or not  y     
x the contour of the heart shape that identifies the area enclosed by the hands 
this project is part of a bigger project we are undertaking called hand augmented photography
for google glass and other hands free wearable cameras  hands free wearable cameras  such as
google glass  allow the users to take pictures by voice command and thus leaving the users 
hands free  the users can use their hands as an additional interface to the camera  for example 
x hand as aperture  while taking pictures  the users create a hand shape and put it in
front of the device camera as an aperture to customize the picture frame and what part of
the scene will be enclosed by the hand figure  the resulted image is cropped to the shape
of the hand shape 
x hand as zoom  the users can also create a rectangular frame with their hands  and then
enlarge or shrink the rectangular frame to indicate zoom out and zoom in  respectively 
this is very useful as google glass camera does not have an optical zoom component 
x document scanning  the users can put their hands alongside the boundary of a
document while taking its picture  then  the document will be cropped out 
x hand gesture language  google glass can detect and understand the meaning of
different hand shapes  and thus can assist the users in understanding the emotion and
implication of the subject through their hand gestures

   hand shape detector using a adaboost cascade of haar like features
this algorithm adopts viola jones object detection method      the algorithm is based on haarlike features  adaboost algorithm for classifier learning  and a cascade of fast and simple
classifiers to build an efficient strong classifier 
haar like features 
a haar like feature is window that is divided into sub regions  figure    shows haar like
features used in this project 

figure    haar like features 
haar like features are used to detect features present in images  for example  edge haar like
features detect edges in images as follows 
x the haar like feature window is scanned over the image 
x the value of the feature is computed by the intensity difference between the sum of
pixels in the white area and the sum of pixels in the black area 

                             
x

an edge is detected if the f value is greater  or smaller  than some threshold tf 

fia single feature classifier h x  for an image x is given by 
           
      
 eq    
                      
where pf is a binary indicating the direction of the inequality sign  threshold tf is a parameter
that will be learned from the training images 
simple haar like features can be combined to produce more complex features  for example the
following c shape haar like feature in figure   

figure    a  find edges using edge haar like features  b  c shape haar like features 
we can see that c shape haar like features simulate the c shape appearance of left hand and
right hand when two hands are making the heart shape  the training phase will determine what
haar like features to be used together with the positions and sizes of each haar like features that
allows it to classify positive and negative images  more specifically  for each haar like feature
and a   x   image  there are about         possibilities of position and size of that feature when
applied on the image  the training process will choose only about          most important
features that yields minimum classification error rate  figure    shows an example of    most
important haar like features that were selected by the training process  we can see that the
combination of these features characterizes some curves similar to the way the hands are
organized to make the heart shape 

figure    fifteen haar like features are selected to form a classifier 
adaboost classifier training algorithm 
adaboost will scan the training images many times  each time with a different size and position
of haar like features  to find the best size and position of the feature and a threshold that best
separate the positive and negative training images  adaboost algorithm learns a classifier as
follows     

fix

x

start with uniform weights on training examples  let   xi  yi         xn  yn   denote training
images where yi     or   is the label  the initial weight of a training image i is given by 
x

  

x

  






  if yi      where p is the number of positive training images 
  if yi      where q is the number of negative training images 

for each iteration t         t  where t is the number of haar like features we want to
incorporate into each classifier  for example t      in figure    





  

x

normalize all the weights 

x

for each feature f  out of         possible features   train a classifier hf x   eq     
then compute the classification error of this classifier as a weighted sum of

x
x


 


incorrectly samples      
          
choose the classifier ht x  that has minimum classification error              
re weight the training samples 

  reduce the weight of correctly classified samples  
x

 


 
 


  keep the weight of incorrectly classified samples unchanged 
t best features are finally combined to create the classifier  the decision strength of each
feature is weighted by the error rate it makes  if a feature makes less error  its decision
 the label it assigns to a sample  is more likely to be the final label of the sample 




                        
     


                                                                                          

the re weighting step reduces the weight of correctly samples while keeping the weight of
incorrectly samples high  let v denote the set of these incorrectly classified samples  in the next
iteration  samples in v will contribute more to the error rate  forcing the adaboost to select a
feature that can classify correctly as many samples in v as possible 
cascade classifier 
scanning a large number of best features  in the order of     or       will take a long time  to
quickly reject negative image windows as early as possible  the set of best features are divided
into a number of cascade stages each of which contains        features  an image must pass all
the stages to be classified positive  failure at any of the stage will make the image rejected classified negative  the cascade classifier is shown in figure

fi   hand shape contour extraction
the hands in the foreground of an image characterize strong edges from the image background 
a state of the art contour detection can be used to extract the contour of the hand shape  this
project uses the contour detector developed by arbelaez et al       the hand shape contour
extraction is as follows 
x run the contour detector 
x choose top   strongest contours from the set of all contours found by the detector 
x remove opened and short contours 
x the biggest closed contour left is predicted the hand shape contour 

figure    original positive image and its hand shape contour

   results
the classifier is tested on      positive images and      negative images  the testing result is
given in the following table 
x testing accuracy     
x precision     
x recall     

there are more revenues to improve the classifier s performance 
x clean training data  some negative images contain objects that have heart shapes and or
c curve shapes  we need to clean the negative images 
x add skin color  skin color may be an effective additional indicator of hands because skin
features a small range of color and texture     
x train by edges  since the hand shape is in the foreground of the image  its contour
dominates most of the contours of other objects in the background  hence  the positive
training images should be converted into edges before being fed to the training phase
