abstract
in this project  we study the problem of classifying genes into biologically meaningful clusters by
applying machine learning techniques to gene expression data  our data consists of gene expression
data from two types of mouse immunological cells  t cells and granulocytes  as well as data that
summarizes known biological pathways and genetic associations in mice  we utilize this data about
previously studied and understood genetic associations to improve the clustering classifications that
are made based on the gene expression data alone 

 

introduction

the applications of gene expression data are numerous  as information about the expression of individual
genes can inform both academic understanding of genetic diseases as well as clinical treatments for
patients  one interesting use of gene expression data is to cluster genes together in a biologically
meaningful way  that is  given gene expression data  we wish to group genes into clusters that correspond
to biological pathways in which the grouped genes code for proteins that work together at a functional
level 
this is a problem that has been studied  as in      one may apply a k means algorithm to a matrix
containing gene expression data to effectively cluster the genes  when attempting to cluster genes 
however  often times a lot of information is already known about genetic associations in biological
pathways  the ability to leverage this data to improve clustering predictions that would be made on the
gene expression data alone is the challenge that we address in this paper 

 

methods

we studied gene expression data that was extracted from two different immunological cell types from   
different mice  mrna levels for        genes were measured using microarrays  this information was
stored in a           matrix d    dij   where dij          is a measure of expression level  a higher value
means higher expression level   further  we accumulated data that summarized        known biological
pathways  this data was stored in a                  matrix p    pij   defined thus 
pij

we ran a k means clustering algorithms on the matrix d for various values of k and used the elbow
method to decide on an optimal k

finding the optimal k

we theorized that there exists a correct clustering of the genes considered  and therefore our chosen
k should be the same for both the original data and the data augmented with the data about priorly
determined pathways  our approach was then to pick a value of k that worked well for both data sets
and compare the clusters produced by running k means on each set and get an idea of the utility of
augmenting gene expression data with pathway priors 
we decided to pick an optimal k using the elbow method  the elbow method  which can be traced
to speculation by thorndike        in      describes a good choice of k for k means  the method can
be described as follows  for fixed k  z  let g denote the set of all training examples and ck the
set of cardinality k of centroids determined by the k means algorithm  now for x  g define x  
arg minsk x    where    denotes the euclidean norm on rn   then define the error of the k means
algorithm to be
k    x  x  
xg

now make a plot of k as a function of k and note where there are elbows in the plot  i e   points that
mark a sharp change in k   an elbow point is a good choice of k  we also performed k means on the
                 matrix m that is just d and p concatenated  performing the elbow method on both
our results from running k means on m and d  we picked an optimal k for clustering 

figure    example of elbow method
then  we compared the results of k means on m versus the results of k means on d by comparing the
similarity between the clusters determined by both methods  using the following method 

   

choosing the optimal weight

our strategy for incorporating the prior data is to prepend the gene expressions data matrix d to the
genetic pathways matrix p multiplied by a scalar   which corresponds to how much we want to weight
the information about known pathways  we consider each genetic pathway as an addition feature to a
gene data point  the result is a matrix in rmn   where m           n   a   b  a          and b       we
constructed a finite set s  r of potential candidates for   ran k means on the concatenated matrices
with different choices of   s and compared the results to find the optimal choice for  
to pick our initial value  in s  we scaled p such that it has approximately equal weight relative to d 
this can be computed by normalizing d to be between   and    and scaling p as follows

a argmaxp p  

then  we selected our set s of s to test by picking an even number of values greater than and smaller
than    such that each  increments evenly and begins at zero 
thus  our equation for i for the set s             r   is
i  

b ri 
 a argmaxp p  

then  to test each selection of   we used the two fold cross validation method  in a typical supervised
learning problem  cross validation is used to test a trained model on classifying a subset of the original
data  we can make a normative judgement about the quality of our unsupervised learning model by using
distance as our metric of comparison  as opposed to label classification  the choice of  that produces
the clusters that are most tightly clustered with randomly selected test data may be the optimal choice
of   we can conduct this analysis as follows 
   divide each matrix d and p into train and test  validate  matrices by randomly splitting up the
genes into two groups dt   dv   pt   and pv such that dt and pt have     the rows of d and p   and
dv and pv have the remaining     
   for each value i  s  compute the horizontal concatenation matrices xi t    dt  pt    and xi v  
 dv  pv    
   run the k means clustering algorithm on xi t with the optimal selection of k from section     to
produce the result vector ci of centroid locations 
   then  evaluate the clustering model by testing on the remaining     validation data  for each
row xj in xi v  assign a cluster by finding the closest cluster cj in c 
k

cj   argminc  xj  cd 
d  

the error value i is computed by summing the distances between each point xj and their corresponding cluster centroid cj  
mv

 
xj  cj
j   dj

i   

where dj is the number of points assigned to cluster cj  
   pick the i with the lowest classification error i  
to smooth out inconsistencies and ensure that our conclusion was more generalizable  we decided to run
this algorithm multiple times and compare the averages of each i for our analysis  this helps reduce
the effects of the random initial assignment of cluster positions when running the k means algorithm 
and local extrema in the training data set xv  

 

data

because it is incredibly computationally expensive to run the k means algorithm on all of our data set
with thousands of features and training sets  we chose to run k means only on the first       genes as a
proof of concept of our method 

 

fiwe ran the k means algorithm first on the gene expression data d on varying values of k and plotted
the results of the error function j to determine the location of the elbow points that mark the optimal
choice
of k  we made the assumption that the optimal choice of k would be something close to the value
k    n    as suggested by mardia et al  in      then  we chose values of k that deviated from k  by    
thus  our choices of k ranged from    to     this produced the graph shown in figure  a  we repeated
the same procedure with the gene expression data agumented with pathway priors m   the plot of our
k means error values for each value of k on m can be seen in figure  b 

 a  error of k means run with varying k on expres   b  error of k means run with varying k on the

figure    the elbow method for determining an optimal k 
from this analysis  we determined that the optimal choice of k was aproximately    due to the fact that
in both figures  a and  b  there was a sharp change in the slope of the plot of k means error values
around the point where k      
we then compared the results of k means on m versus the results of k means on d by comparing the
similarity between the clusters determined by both methods where for both k      using the algorithm
described in section      we determined that selecting k      gave us a reasonable error 
we then ran our   fold cross validation algorithm to find the optimal choice of  in the concatenation
of d and p   we first trained a cluster model on     of our original data set  and tested the resulting
clusters on the remaining     to produce an error value for each i as described in section     
after running our validation algorithm ten times  taking the average of each trials i values  we were
able to identify the optimal        as shown in figure    thus  we could select the optimal scalar

further research

the analysis we have done thus far has been limited due to the computational load of running our
algorithms on large data sets  our next steps are to run our analysis on all        genes over more
varied choices of k to get a more accurate clustering and more optimal choice of k 
once we have this choice of k  we would evaluate it with the following method 
   enumerate all possible bijective mappings between the clusters trained on the data and the clusters
trained on the data augmented with priors 
   sort these mappings by the number of points shared by each 
   go through and accept these mappings in sorted order  if a given mapping has a cluster already
accepted  reject that mapping and move on 
   find the total number of points shared by each mapping pair c found via this method  subtract
this value from the total number of points k and divide by the total number of points     kc
k
furthermore  we would like to extend our methodology to explore more strategies for incorporating
the prior data into our gene expression data for clustering analysis  thus far  we have only tried
concatenating the pathways data to our gene expression data unweighted  we would like to explore
weighting the pathways data other strategies
